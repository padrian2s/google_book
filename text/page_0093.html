      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Business is permanently global, but humans are naturally provincial. Get out of your comfort zone whenever possible -- go live and work somewhere else. Seek international assignments at big companies; your managers will value you more for it. If working overseas isn't an option, travel and see the world as your customers do. Walk through stores, pick up papers, talk to taxi drivers -- you'll be amazed by the insights. The final career point comes from Sheryl Sandberg: "It is the ultimate luxury to combine passion and contribution. It's also a very clear path to happiness." Finding that combination isn't always simple or affordable, but it's worth pursuing. Start by adjusting your five-year ideal job to be closer to your dream job while remaining attainable. Setting the right goal, even imperfectly, can turn around people's careers.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The global perspective advice connects to the theme of expanding aperture -- just as hiring benefits from broader candidate pools, careers benefit from broader worldviews. The Sandberg quote positioning passion-plus-contribution as both luxury and path to happiness provides a aspirational capstone for the career advice section. The acknowledgment that combining passion and contribution is rare and sometimes unaffordable adds important realism to what could otherwise be overly idealistic advice. The practical suggestion to gradually shift your career goal toward your dream rather than making a dramatic leap shows the deliberate, iterative approach characteristic of the whole book.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Seek international work experience or at minimum travel to understand global perspectives. If you can't work abroad, see the world through your customers' eyes by visiting their environments. Articulate where your passion and contribution currently overlap and where they diverge. Make your five-year ideal job a bridge between your current path and your dream -- not a sudden leap but a deliberate course correction. Recognize that combining passion and contribution is a process, not a destination, and keep adjusting your course as you learn more about yourself and the world.</p>
