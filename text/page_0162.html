      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors thank Larry Page and Sergey Brin for their wisdom and the incredible company they built. They describe the privilege of working with the founders daily, noting that many of the brilliant things that made Google great -- strategy, culture, emphasis on hiring excellence -- were set before either author joined. They express gratitude for the support staff, PR people, legal advisors, and the many Googlers who helped get stories straight and teach the finer points of managing smart creatives.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The acknowledgments reinforce a key book theme: success requires many brilliant people working together. The specific mention of Bill Campbell as "the most gifted of all management coaches" underscores his outsized influence on both Apple and Google. The breadth of acknowledgments -- from product managers to lawyers to family members -- reflects the collaborative culture the book advocates.</p>
