      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 45 explores one of psychology's most robust findings: "bad is stronger than good." The authors cite Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, and Vohs's landmark paper "Bad Is Stronger Than Good" (Review of General Psychology, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2001) and Felps, Mitchell, and Byington's research on organizational bad apples (Research in Organizational Behavior, Volume 27, January 2006). In organizations, it often takes only a few bad apples to spoil the barrel.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>A few toxic individuals can disproportionately damage team performance and culture -- the negative impact outweighs the positive contributions of many good employees. This research provides the scientific basis for the book's emphasis on rigorous hiring -- preventing bad hires matters more than finding stars. The asymmetry between positive and negative influence explains why cultural protection requires active vigilance.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Prioritize screening out toxic candidates over finding exceptional ones -- one bad hire can undo the positive contributions of many good employees. Act quickly when team members consistently exhibit negative behaviors; the longer you wait, the more damage spreads. Design your culture to be resilient against negative influences by establishing clear values and accountability.</p>
