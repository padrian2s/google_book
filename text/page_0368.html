      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Khosla's call to maintain the Silicon Valley vision connects to the book's broader theme about the importance of culture in driving innovation. As companies and regions grow and mature, there is a natural tendency toward risk aversion and incrementalism. Actively maintaining a culture of bold ambition requires deliberate effort and vigilance against complacency.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Actively protect and nurture your organization's innovative culture, especially as it grows. Success breeds conservatism, so establish mechanisms -- such as moonshot projects, innovation labs, or dedicated time for experimentation -- that keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive even as the company scales.</p>
