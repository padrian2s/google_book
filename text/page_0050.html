      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Henry Ford said if he'd listened to customers, he would have looked for faster horses. Incremental innovation works for incumbents protecting market share but is insufficient for new ventures. Basing products on technical insights avoids me-too products. The authors then pivot to the importance of scale -- not growth in the traditional 8% quarterly sense, but rapid global scaling. In the Internet Century, with democratized information, connectivity, computing, and manufacturing, global reach is within anyone's grasp. Competition is intense and advantages don't last, making "grow big fast" essential. Platforms are the key -- multisided markets that bring together users and providers. YouTube, the telephone network, and Facebook all demonstrate how platforms become more valuable as they grow. Facebook hit a billion users in eight years; Android activated its billionth device in five years.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The distinction between growth (incremental) and scale (rapid, global expansion). Platform thinking as the key to Internet Century success -- platforms grow more valuable as they add users (network effects). The pattern of prioritizing growth over revenue in early stages, as Google did by not placing ads on its homepage despite massive traffic. The counter-example of Excite@Home and AOL prioritizing revenue over growth and suffering for it. The necessity of having a clear revenue model even while prioritizing growth -- "no idea how to make money" doesn't work.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build platforms, not just products -- create systems that become more valuable as more people use them. Prioritize growth and user experience over short-term revenue optimization in early stages. Have a clear (if general) revenue model from the start, even while deferring monetization. Share generously with partners to accelerate platform growth rather than maximizing your take on each transaction. When partners want to increase ads or monetization at the expense of user experience, counsel them against it.</p>
