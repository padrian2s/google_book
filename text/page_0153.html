      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Borders had a market capitalization of over $1.6 billion in 2005 and employed seventeen thousand people when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Incumbent businesses face a choice: continue operating with technology merely optimizing efficiency, or use platforms for genuine transformation. The dig-a-moat-and-bury-your-head approach -- using lobbyists and lawyers to fight disruption -- is bound to fail because the forces of technology and disruption are too powerful. The alternative is to develop a strategy using platforms, attract smart creatives, and create an environment where they can succeed at scale. But this is extremely hard for incumbents because mature companies are naturally risk-averse.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Vinod Khosla identifies two structural barriers for incumbents: at the corporate level, innovative new things look like small opportunities not worth the effort; at the individual level, people aren't rewarded for risk-taking but are penalized for failure. The asymmetric individual payoff means the rational person opts for safety. These structural factors explain why disruption is so hard for incumbents to address even when they see it coming. The authors acknowledge they don't always see change coming either -- noting they were among the last Googlers to ditch their BlackBerrys.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Recognize that fighting disruption through regulation and lobbying is a losing strategy. Create reward structures that encourage risk-taking, not just safety. Develop platform strategies that create increasing returns and value as usage grows. Surround yourself with people who see change coming, especially when you can't see it yourself. Be honest about your organization's natural resistance to change.</p>
