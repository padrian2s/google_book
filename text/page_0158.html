      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors are technology optimists who believe in the power of technology to make the world a better place. They see most big problems as information problems -- with enough data and the ability to crunch it, virtually any challenge facing humanity can be solved. The explosion of data (from geological sensors to wearable technology like Google's smart contact lenses) and practically limitless computing power create an amazing playground for smart creatives to solve big problems. Greater collaboration among scientists, doctors, engineers, designers, and artists will result from easier data sharing. Google's Fusion Tables product allows related data sets to be merged and analyzed together.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The information-problem framing is both optimistic and practical. If problems are fundamentally information problems, then the solution is better data collection, sharing, and analysis. Speed of technology adoption is accelerating -- while the steam engine took two hundred years to transform society, modern communications technologies transformed daily life in less than a decade. The rise of computer-aided intelligence (humans collaborating with computers, as in chess) suggests a future where technology amplifies human capability rather than replacing it.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Frame your biggest challenges as information problems -- what data would you need to solve them? Invest in data collection and sharing infrastructure. Break down information silos within your organization and across industry boundaries. Look for opportunities where combining previously separate data sets could yield breakthrough insights. Embrace human-computer collaboration as a force multiplier.</p>
