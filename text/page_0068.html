      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The ideal candidate has passion, intellect, integrity, and a unique perspective. Finding and hiring her requires four links: sourcing, interviewing, hiring, and compensation. Sourcing starts with defining the candidate type, and Google's recruiting partner Martha Josephson calls this "expanding the aperture" -- like a camera lens, a wider aperture captures more. A typical hiring manager has a narrow aperture, considering only people with certain titles in certain fields. The successful manager sets a wider aperture. If you want talent from a specific company that guards its people, expand the aperture to find those who want new challenges their current employer can't provide -- the engineer blocked from moving to product management, the PM who wants sales experience. People willing to take risks introduce the exact self-selection tendency you want. Hire the best engineer regardless of coding language preference.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The camera aperture metaphor brilliantly captures the trade-off in hiring: a narrow aperture gives predictable but limited results, while a wider aperture captures unexpected brilliance. The self-selection insight is powerful -- people willing to take career risks to join you are demonstrating exactly the risk-tolerant, growth-oriented mindset you want. The Kevin Systrom story (denied transfer to APM program because he lacked a CS degree, left to cofound Instagram) is a cautionary tale about aperture too narrow even for Google. Supercomputer pioneer Seymour Cray deliberately hired for inexperience to get people who "do not usually know what's supposed to be impossible."</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When sourcing candidates, deliberately look beyond the obvious profile. Consider people from adjacent roles, industries, or backgrounds who show trajectory and learning ability. If a candidate has the right fundamentals but lacks specific experience, that inexperience may actually be an advantage -- they won't be constrained by "how it's always been done." Give smart recent graduates vital roles on real projects despite their inexperience. Judge candidates on trajectory, not just current position.</p>
