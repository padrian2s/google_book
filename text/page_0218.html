      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 58 recounts how Jonathan called the trio of Marissa Mayer, Salar Kamangar, and Susan Wojcicki a "pack of camels" because they always had their own ideas and generally refused to follow him. Eventually this came to be a term of endearment. This anecdote illustrates the book's theme that the best employees think independently and push back on authority.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The fact that three of Google's most successful leaders were characterized by refusing to follow orders validates the book's argument that smart creatives should not be managed traditionally. The nickname becoming a "term of endearment" shows how healthy organizations learn to celebrate rather than punish independence.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When your best employees resist direction, consider that their independence may be a feature, not a bug -- channel their energy rather than suppressing it. Create an environment where strong-willed leaders are celebrated; organizations that only value compliance will never attract the most innovative talent.</p>
