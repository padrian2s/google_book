      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Platforms scale more quickly when they are open. The Internet itself is the greatest example -- Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn's decision to keep TCP/IP open, letting any network connect to any other, directly created the remarkable web we use today. AT&T's landline network stagnated when closed but innovation exploded when the government forced it open -- new phones, fax machines, data modems, and cheap long-distance calling emerged. The IBM PC's open architecture in 1981 allowed software developers and manufacturers to build applications and clones without licensing fees, establishing it as the dominant computing standard and launching Microsoft and Intel. "Open" generally means sharing intellectual property, adhering to open standards, and giving customers freedom to leave your platform. This seems heretical to MBA thinking (defend the fortress with boiling oil), but with open you trade control for scale and innovation.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Historical pattern: closed platforms stagnate while open platforms generate waves of innovation. The trade-off of control for scale and innovation. Open as a competitive weapon against entrenched incumbents feeding at closed troughs. The combination of disruptive product + disruptive business model (open) as a powerful attack strategy. Education disruption (Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity) as a current example of technology + open business model challenging incumbents.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Default to open unless you have a specific, compelling reason to stay closed. Use openness as a competitive weapon against closed incumbents -- their very entrenchedness becomes your advantage. Recognize that open drives innovation into your ecosystem and drives down costs of complementary components. Make it easy for customers to leave your platform -- this forces you to compete on merit and builds genuine loyalty. Consider Bill Joy's law: "No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else." Open lets you harness their talent.</p>
