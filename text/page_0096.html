      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This page introduces the Decisions chapter with the story of Google's China crisis. In December 2009, Google discovered it was under sophisticated attack from hackers who had accessed corporate servers. Unlike previous attacks aimed at disruption, these hackers were stealing intellectual property and trying to access Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attacks originated from China. About five years earlier, in mid-2004, Google had entered the Chinese market -- a huge opportunity with more people than any other country and tens of millions of Internet users. There was a local competitor in Baidu, Yahoo was gaining momentum, and Larry and Sergey were impressed by the innovation and talent in China. But while business indicators favored entering, the "don't-be-evil" indicators were mixed.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The China story is chosen as the chapter's framing narrative because it exemplifies the most difficult kind of decision -- one where business interests and values conflict. The structure of opening with the crisis (2009 hacking) and then flashing back to the original entry decision (2004) creates dramatic tension that mirrors how the actual decision unfolded. The juxtaposition of business indicators (massive market, talent pool) against ethical indicators (censorship, information freedom) sets up the central tension of the chapter: how to make decisions when the data pulls in different directions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When facing major decisions, explicitly separate business indicators from values indicators and evaluate each independently. Recognize that some decisions involve genuine conflicts between growth opportunities and core principles -- there may not be a comfortable answer. The China entry decision illustrates why it's important to consider ethical implications alongside business cases from the very beginning, rather than treating them as afterthoughts.</p>
