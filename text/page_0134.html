      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Google bought Motorola, Dennis Woodside discovered dozens of different phones targeted at specific market segments. This "sprawl of mediocrity" came from making many small bets. In contrast, the iPhone is popular precisely because it's the only phone Apple makes -- if there's a problem, no one goes home until there's a plan. Big challenges also attract big talent: there's a symbiotic relationship between challenges and smart people. Mike Cassidy, a serial entrepreneur who joined Google in 2010, stayed because he got to work on Project Loon -- an audacious project that kept him from leaving. Thinking big is contagious and inspires even people far removed from moonshot projects.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The mediocrity trap is real: when you make many small, safe bets, you end up with a portfolio of adequate products rather than exceptional ones. Apple's singular focus forces excellence because failure is not an option. The talent-attraction dynamic is powerful -- smart creatives choose companies that aim for 10X improvement over those settling for 10%. Even employees in non-moonshot roles are inspired by the company's overall ambition, making "think big" both a recruiting and retention strategy.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Resist the urge to spread resources across many small initiatives. Concentrate on fewer, bigger bets where failure is not an option. Use audacious goals to attract and retain top talent. Create an environment where thinking big is the expectation for everyone, not just special projects teams.</p>
