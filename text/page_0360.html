      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (198) references Teresa M. Amabile's seminal Harvard Business Review article "How to Kill Creativity" (September-October 1998). Amabile's research identifies the organizational practices that systematically destroy creative output, including excessive oversight, time pressure without purpose, and political maneuvering.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Amabile's work is foundational to understanding why so many organizations fail at innovation despite wanting to succeed. Her research shows that creativity is fragile and easily destroyed by well-intentioned but poorly designed management practices. This connects to the book's emphasis on creating the right environment (the "primordial ooze") for innovation rather than trying to mandate creative output.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Audit your organization's practices against Amabile's creativity killers. Are you providing autonomy, meaningful challenges, and sufficient resources? Or are bureaucratic processes, arbitrary deadlines, and internal politics stifling the creative potential of your smart creatives?</p>
