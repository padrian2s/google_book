      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 149 highlights that many product managers who worked on Google's board preparation team went on to have very successful careers. Sundar Pichai ran the team for Jonathan for several years and later headed Android, Chrome, and Apps. Caesar Sengupta partnered with Sundar on board slides and later ran the Chromebooks team. The authors suggest this correlation is not coincidental.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note illustrates the principle that exposure to high-level strategic work accelerates career development.

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Give high-potential employees exposure to strategic, cross-functional work early in their careers. Tasks like board preparation, strategy reviews, and executive briefings force people to think beyond their immediate domain and develop the broad perspective needed for senior leadership. These stretch assignments serve as both development opportunities and talent identification mechanisms.</p>
