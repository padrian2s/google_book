      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors close the introduction with both humility and a call to action. They acknowledge their luck in joining a spectacular company at a unique moment in history, and that they don't have all the answers. But they believe their lessons apply broadly -- to large enterprises, start-ups, nonprofits, NGOs, and governments. The book is addressed to "you, entrepreneur" -- defined broadly as anyone with an idea they're sure will change everything, whether launching a start-up or driving change within an existing organization. The principles aren't just for Silicon Valley or high-tech. All you need is the insight that your industry is transforming, the guts to take a risk, and the ability to attract and lead smart creatives. As Drucker noted, the Egyptian who built the pyramids was just a successful manager. The Internet Century brims with pyramids yet unbuilt.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The democratization of entrepreneurship -- these principles apply to anyone trying to start something new, from any context. The redefinition of "entrepreneur" beyond Silicon Valley start-up founders to include corporate innovators, nonprofit leaders, and government reformers. The acknowledgment that skilled leaders within existing organizations can often have greater impact than start-ups. The optimistic framing that the Internet Century is still early and full of unbuilt opportunities.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't let your context -- whether corporate, nonprofit, or government -- prevent you from applying entrepreneurial principles. Recognize that existing organizations with their resources and reach can be more powerful platforms for change than start-ups. The three requirements for success: insight that your industry is transforming, willingness to take risks, and ability to attract talented people. Start building -- the opportunities of the Internet Century are still largely untapped.</p>
