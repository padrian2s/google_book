      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 164 shares a humorous anecdote about Jeff (likely Jeff Dean or another senior Google executive) whose bio on the Google website listed a master's degree from Harvard when it was actually an MBA. Jeff omitted this distinction to protect his engineering "street cred," reflecting the strong engineering-first culture at Google where technical credentials are highly valued.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This anecdote illustrates the deep engineering-centric culture at Google, where an MBA might actually be seen as a liability rather than an asset in terms of peer credibility. It highlights the tension between business and engineering perspectives that the book explores throughout, and the importance of technical excellence as a core cultural value.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Understand the cultural values and status signals within your organization. In engineering-driven companies, technical credibility often matters more than formal business credentials. Leaders who bridge both worlds -- possessing both technical understanding and business acumen -- are particularly valuable, but they should lead with the credential that carries more weight in their organizational culture.</p>
