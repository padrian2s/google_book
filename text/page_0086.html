      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Firing isn't as bad as getting fired, but it's still plenty bad. The factors that make smart creatives great hires -- intensity, confidence, fearlessness -- also make them difficult to fire. The best way to avoid having to fire underperformers is to not hire them in the first place, which is why Google's hiring process generates more false negatives (people they should have hired but didn't) than false positives (people they shouldn't have hired but did). A useful self-test: If you could trade the bottom 10 percent of your team for new hires, would the organization improve? If yes, examine the hiring process that yielded those low performers. Another test: Are there members of your team whom, if they said they were leaving, you would not fight hard to keep? If so, perhaps you should let them go. One last note: beware of people who enjoy firing -- it instills a culture of fear and becomes an excuse for not investing in the hiring process.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The preference for false negatives over false positives in hiring is a deliberate quality-over-quantity trade-off. It's better to miss a good candidate than to hire a bad one, because the cost of a bad hire (cultural damage, management time, firing difficulty) exceeds the opportunity cost of a missed good hire. The two self-tests provide practical diagnostic tools for assessing team quality. The warning about people who enjoy firing highlights a toxic management pattern where firing substitutes for good hiring -- it's easier to fire quickly than to invest in getting hiring right.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design your hiring process to err on the side of not hiring rather than hiring the wrong person. Regularly apply the "bottom 10 percent" and "would you fight to keep them" tests to assess your team. When you must fire someone, do it with dignity and recognize that it reflects a failure in the hiring process, not just the individual. Never use "I'll just fire them" as justification for lowering hiring standards. Invest the time saved from not having to fire people in improving your hiring process instead.</p>
