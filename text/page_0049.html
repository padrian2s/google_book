      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors share a memorable example of broadening a narrow solution. When Google Search gained popularity, many queries were adult-oriented. Existing porn filters were ineffective, so a small team developed SafeSearch by combining two technical insights: understanding image content (detecting skin) and judging context through user interaction patterns (users searching for porn don't click on medical textbook images). SafeSearch became far more effective than anything else on the web. But the team didn't stop there -- they used the content-based models developed for SafeSearch to improve image relevance for all queries, then added features to find similar images, and finally enabled searching by photograph instead of text. All of these capabilities evolved from technology initially developed for the porn filter.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The pattern of narrow solutions becoming platforms for broader innovation. The combination of content analysis and behavioral analysis as a powerful dual insight. Building on unexpected starting points -- adult content filtering leading to image search breakthroughs. The iterative expansion of capability: filter content, then rate relevance, then find similar images, then search by image. The principle that initial use cases don't define the ultimate potential of a technology.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When you develop a solution for a narrow problem, systematically explore what else the underlying technology can do. Don't dismiss unglamorous starting points -- some of the best innovations come from solving "embarrassing" problems. Look for ways to combine content analysis with behavioral analysis in your domain. Build capabilities incrementally, expanding from narrow solutions to broader platforms.</p>
