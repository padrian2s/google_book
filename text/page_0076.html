      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>From the interviewer's standpoint, the goal of the interview is to form an opinion -- a strong yes or no. Google grades candidates on a scale of 1 to 4. The average score falls around 3, which translates to "I'll be okay with this person but someone else should like them a lot." As an average it's fine, but as an individual response it's a cop-out -- the interviewer can't make up their mind. On the product management team, a score of 4.0 meant "This person is perfect. If you don't hire them, expect to hear from me." The language was deliberately emotional because smart creatives care about who joins their team -- it's personal. Interviewers must be told what to have opinions about. Google breaks candidate evaluations into four categories kept consistent across functions: Leadership, Role-Related Knowledge, General Cognitive Ability, and Googleyness.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The insistence on strong opinions (not wishy-washy 3s) creates accountability in the interview process. The emotional language attached to scores ("expect to hear from me") transforms interviewing from a bureaucratic task into a personal commitment. The four evaluation categories (Leadership, Role-Related Knowledge, General Cognitive Ability, Googleyness) provide a structured framework that works across all functions -- from sales to engineering -- ensuring consistency while preserving flexibility for role-specific assessment. Smart creatives scoring well on all four categories regardless of function suggests these are universal qualities of high performers.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create a clear rating scale with specific language for each score that forces interviewers to take a position. Discourage middle-of-the-road scores by requiring justification for ambiguous ratings. Establish consistent evaluation categories across all functions to enable apples-to-apples comparisons. Train interviewers on what each category means and what good versus great looks like. Make the interview process feel personal -- interviewers should feel they're inviting someone into their team, not just filling a requisition.</p>
