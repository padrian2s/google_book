      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 160 is a humorous aside directed at atheist readers, clarifying that a reference to God in the main text is metaphorical. The punchline -- "You may not believe in God, but even God believes in CEOs" -- uses wit to underscore the importance of strong CEO leadership in driving organizational vision and direction.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note exemplifies the authors' characteristic use of humor to deliver serious points. The underlying message is that regardless of one's philosophy, the role of the CEO as the ultimate decision-maker and vision-setter is an organizational reality that must be respected. This connects to the book's discussion of how even flat, democratic organizations need clear leadership.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Even in the most open, collaborative, and flat organizations, someone must make the final call on critical decisions. Embrace the role of decisive leadership while maintaining the consultative, data-driven approach the authors advocate. The CEO's job is not to make every decision, but to ensure that the right decisions get made.</p>
