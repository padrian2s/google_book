      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Eric received advice about turnarounds: "Find the smart people first. To find them, find one of them." At Novell, he asked a smart engineer to list the ten smartest people he knew. When Eric scheduled one-on-one meetings with them, each arrived terrified -- at Novell, one-on-ones with the CEO meant you were being fired. This was an early lesson in how difficult changing incumbent culture can be. Sound advice was derailed by cultural assumptions Eric hadn't anticipated. The authors share principles for cultural transformation: recognize the real culture (not the stated one), connect business failures to cultural causes without insulting people, articulate the new vision, and take specific high-profile steps. At Motorola Mobility (acquired in 2012), they learned the hardest lesson: cultural change takes far more time than expected.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The difficulty of cultural change in established organizations -- even good intentions can be misinterpreted through the lens of existing culture. The "find one smart person to find ten" approach to identifying talent in turnarounds. The importance of understanding the existing culture before trying to change it. The principle of connecting business failures to cultural causes to build the case for change. Cultural transformation as a multi-year endeavor, not a quick fix. Lou Gerstner's IBM turnaround as a model for building on a founder's original vision while scrapping obsolete practices.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Before attempting cultural change, thoroughly understand the existing culture and its unwritten rules. When changing culture, connect the need for change to business outcomes rather than criticizing people. Take specific, visible actions that demonstrate the new culture in practice. Be patient -- cultural transformation in established organizations takes much longer than expected. Build on the best of the existing culture rather than trying to replace everything at once.</p>
