      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The table of contents reveals the book's structure: each major chapter is organized around a provocative thesis (e.g., "Your Plan Is Wrong," "Believe Your Own Slogans"), with sub-sections named after memorable principles and maxims. This structure makes the book function both as a narrative and as a reference guide, where readers can quickly find specific advice on topics like "The Bezos two-pizza rule" or "Don't listen to the HiPPOs."</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use the table of contents as a quick-reference index for specific management challenges. Each sub-heading encapsulates a principle that can be applied independently, making this useful for revisiting specific advice without rereading the entire book.</p>
