      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the word "innovation" appeared in US company reports over 33,000 times in 2011. The authors define innovation as the production and implementation of novel and useful ideas. For something to be truly innovative, it needs to be new, surprising, and radically useful. Google's self-driving cars clearly fit this definition. But Google also releases over 500 improvements to its search engine each year -- individually incremental, but collectively they represent radical improvement. This inclusive definition means innovation is not just about moonshots but also about the cumulative power of many small advances.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The three-part test for innovation (new, surprising, radically useful) provides a practical filter. The distinction between individual incremental improvements and their collective radical impact is crucial -- it means that the search team working on a fifteen-year-old product is just as much in the innovation business as Google[x] working on self-driving cars. This inclusive spirit gives most everyone the chance to come up with truly big things.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Apply the three-part test: Is it new? Is it surprising? Is it radically useful? If customers are asking for it, you are being responsive, not innovative. Don't limit innovation to a special group in an off-campus building -- recognize that cumulative small improvements can be just as innovative as moonshots. Give everyone the opportunity and permission to innovate.</p>
