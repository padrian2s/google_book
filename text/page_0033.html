      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors distinguish between knaves and divas using the classic knights-and-knaves logic puzzle. Knaves lack integrity -- they are arrogant, jealous, take credit for others' work, and are sloppy and selfish. Knavish behavior has tipping points: when knave density reaches a critical mass (smaller than you think), people start believing they need to be knavish to succeed. In healthy cultures, knights call out knaves until they shape up or leave. Crowded offices help because humans behave better with social controls. As a manager, reduce knaves' responsibility and act swiftly for egregious offenses. Divas, however, are different -- their difficult behavior stems from high exceptionalism, not low integrity. They think they're better than the team but want success for both. As long as contributions match egos, divas should be tolerated and protected.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The critical distinction between knaves (low integrity) and divas (high exceptionalism). Knave density tipping points -- small numbers of bad actors can corrupt an entire culture. Social norming as a self-correcting mechanism in healthy cultures. The connection between crowded offices and social accountability. Tom Peters' insight: "There is no such thing as a minor lapse of integrity." The importance of protecting difficult but exceptional contributors from cultural pressure to conform.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Act swiftly to remove knaves -- don't wait for the tipping point where knavish behavior becomes normalized. Distinguish between people who are difficult because they lack integrity (knaves) and those who are difficult because they are exceptional (divas). Protect your divas from cultural pressure to conform, as long as their contributions outweigh collateral damage. Use crowded, collaborative environments as a natural check on antisocial behavior.</p>
