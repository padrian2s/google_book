      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 62 provides a comprehensive explanation of Moore's Law -- Intel cofounder Gordon Moore's prediction that computing power would double every two years (originally every year in his 1965 article). The authors note the prediction has held true but cite research suggesting it will eventually hit physical or economic limits, referencing Rupp and Selberherr (Proceedings of the IEEE, March 2010) and Rick Merritt (EE Times, August 2013).</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Moore's Law is the engine driving the book's entire thesis about the Internet Century -- exponentially increasing computing power is what makes everything else possible. The authors acknowledge Moore's Law's limits rather than treating it as permanent, showing balanced analysis. Understanding Moore's Law is essential context for understanding why management practices must change.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Plan your strategy with the understanding that computing capabilities will continue to grow dramatically, enabling solutions that seem impossible today. Prepare for the possibility that exponential hardware improvements may slow -- invest in software and algorithmic innovation as complementary drivers of progress.</p>
