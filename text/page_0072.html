      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The most important skill any business person can develop is interviewing -- a claim you've probably never read in a management book or heard in an MBA course. CEOs and VCs preach the primacy of people but rarely explain how to actually evaluate them in a time-constrained interview. The typical response to "what's the most important thing you do at work?" is "go to meetings." Meetings require less preparation the higher up you are. But conducting a good interview requires serious preparation: understanding the role, reading the resume, and most importantly considering your questions. Research the interviewee -- do a Google search, form an opinion, identify interesting aspects. Then ask challenging questions that push the candidate: What was the low point? Why was it successful? Was the candidate the hammer or the egg?</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The claim that interviewing is the most important business skill is deliberately provocative but logically follows from the premise that hiring is the most important thing you do. The contrast between meeting preparation (minimal for senior people) and interview preparation (should be extensive for everyone) reveals a misallocation of effort. The emphasis on preparation -- understanding the candidate before the interview, crafting thoughtful questions -- transforms interviewing from a passive evaluation into an active investigation. The best interviews feel like intellectual discussions between friends, not interrogations.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Prepare thoroughly for every interview: research the candidate, read their resume carefully, and prepare specific questions. Ask questions that reveal insight rather than allow recitation: "What surprised you about...?" or "How did you pay for college?" Force candidates to think rather than recall rehearsed answers. Use scenario questions for senior candidates to reveal whether they trust and rely on their people. Reuse good questions across candidates to calibrate responses. Make the interview a genuine intellectual exchange rather than a one-sided evaluation.</p>
