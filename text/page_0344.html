      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 182 explains self-determination theory (SDT), a prevailing theory of human motivation developed by psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan. SDT posits that all people have fundamental needs for autonomy (freedom to act on their own volition rather than external pressure), competence, and relatedness to others. Work becomes motivating and fulfilling to the extent it satisfies these three needs. The note references a 2000 American Psychologist paper by Ryan and Deci.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>SDT provides the psychological foundation for many of Google's management practices. Twenty percent time addresses the autonomy need; challenging work addresses competence; and the collaborative culture addresses relatedness. The authors ground their practical advice in rigorous psychological research, demonstrating that Google's management innovations are not arbitrary but are aligned with fundamental human motivational needs.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design your work environment to satisfy the three basic psychological needs identified by SDT. Give people autonomy by allowing them to make decisions about how they do their work. Support competence by providing challenging work and opportunities for skill development. Foster relatedness by building a strong team culture and sense of belonging. When any of these needs is unmet, motivation and performance will suffer.</p>
