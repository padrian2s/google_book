      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 39 is a self-deprecating aside: "Computer science inside joke proudly written by Jonathan Rosenberg, economics major. Next footnote." Rosenberg playfully acknowledges his non-technical background while claiming credit for a technical joke, exemplifying the interdisciplinary culture the book advocates.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Rosenberg's joke about being an economics major writing computer science humor reflects Google's culture of intellectual playfulness across disciplines. The fact that a non-engineer rose to SVP at Google underscores the book's point that smart creatives combine diverse skills rather than fitting narrow technical categories.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Encourage cross-disciplinary curiosity -- leaders do not need to be experts in every domain but should engage authentically with fields outside their specialty. Use humor, including self-deprecation, to build rapport across teams with different technical backgrounds.</p>
