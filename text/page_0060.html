      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Jonathan recounts his February 2000 interview with Sergey Brin for the role of product leader at Google. As a senior VP at Excite@Home, Jonathan assumed it was a formality. Sergey asked his favorite interview question: "Could you teach me something complicated I don't know?" Jonathan launched into an economics lecture on marginal cost curves, but Sergey grew bored -- he already knew the calculus. Jonathan pivoted to the topic of courtship, using his own dating methods as a case study, which captured Sergey's attention and got him the job. The broader point: if you ask managers what the most important thing they do at work is, most say "go to meetings," but the right answer is hiring -- just as sports coaches know that drafting and recruiting the best players is paramount.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The anecdote illustrates several key themes: Sergey's interview style was genuinely evaluative rather than ceremonial, even for a senior hire. The ability to read the room and adapt (Jonathan switching topics) demonstrated exactly the kind of smart creative thinking Google valued. The sports coaching analogy powerfully reframes the manager's role -- no amount of tactical brilliance can substitute for having the best talent on the field.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Take your hiring process as seriously for every candidate as Sergey did for a senior VP. Never treat interviews as formalities. When interviewing, test for adaptability and genuine knowledge rather than rehearsed answers. Reframe your own role: like a coach, your primary job is to find and recruit the best people, not just to manage processes and attend meetings.</p>
