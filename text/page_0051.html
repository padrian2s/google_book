      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Internet has expanded the potential to build platforms in any industry by fundamentally changing the economics described by Nobel laureate Ronald Coase. Coase argued firms expand until internal management costs exceed external transaction costs. In the 20th century, this meant large hierarchies and closed networks. Today, as Don Tapscott noted, transaction costs have plunged so steeply that firms should shrink until internal costs no longer exceed external ones. Most companies outsource for cost-cutting, but they miss the bigger point: open networks can fundamentally transform products and business models. Twitter is a publishing platform, Airbnb is a lodging platform, Uber is a transportation platform, 23andMe is a genetics data platform. These companies assembled existing technology in new ways to reimagine existing businesses. This model applies everywhere: travel, automobiles, apparel, restaurants, food, retail.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Coase's framework still holds but leads to opposite conclusions in the Internet age -- firms should be smaller, not larger. The shift from closed, hierarchical 20th-century networks to open, global 21st-century platforms. The distinction between outsourcing for cost savings (common) and building open platforms for product transformation (rare and valuable). Platform opportunities exist in virtually every industry, not just technology. The pattern of combining existing technology components with new business models to disrupt incumbents.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Look at your industry through the lens of platform opportunities -- where can you create multisided markets that become more valuable with use? Don't just outsource for cost savings; ask whether open networks could fundamentally transform your product. Study platform disruptors in other industries (Airbnb, Uber, Square) for patterns applicable to your domain. Recognize that products in virtually every industry can be made better as more people use them -- find the mechanism that enables that in your business.</p>
