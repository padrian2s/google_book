      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>A fine marker of smart creatives is passion -- they care deeply. But truly passionate people don't often use the "P-word." When someone starts a sentence with "I'm passionate about..." and then names something generic like travel or football, it's a red flag. Passionate people don't wear passion on their sleeves; they have it in their hearts and live it. Passion is more than resume-deep -- its hallmarks are persistence, grit, seriousness, and all-encompassing absorption that can't be gauged from a checklist. It's not always synonymous with success; failure is often part of the deal. The passionate person will talk at length about their pursuits, whether professional ("perfecting search") or a hobby (Andy Rubin loves robots, Captain Eric loves planes). These extracurricular passions often yield direct company benefits -- Android's Sky Map was built by amateur astronomers in their spare time.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "don't use the word" insight is a meta-observation about authenticity in interviews -- genuine passion manifests as deep engagement rather than self-labeling. The connection between outside passions and workplace innovation (Sky Map, robots, telescopes) suggests that breadth of interests correlates with creative capacity. The philosophy of "don't get them started" being reversed to "we want to get them started" reflects Google's culture of encouraging whole-person engagement rather than compartmentalizing work and personal interests.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>In interviews, be skeptical of candidates who explicitly claim passion -- instead look for the hallmarks: persistence, deep knowledge, willingness to fail. Get candidates talking about what they care most about and observe how they come alive. Pay attention to how they pursue their passions: solo or social, exclusive or inclusive? This reveals personality traits that are harder to assess through standard professional questions. Value candidates with deep extracurricular interests as they often bring unexpected creative connections to their work.</p>
