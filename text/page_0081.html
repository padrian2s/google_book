      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Once you get smart creatives on board, you need to pay them well -- exceptional people deserve exceptional pay. The sports world provides guidance: outstanding athletes receive outstanding compensation. The best player on a professional team may earn hundreds of millions while a bench rookie earns hundreds of thousands. These stars are worth it because they possess rare skills that are tremendously leverageable -- they help teams win, driving fans, viewers, jerseys, and revenue. Smart creatives share the potential for disproportionate impact with professional athletes. Top performers get paid well in athletics and should in business too. If you want better performance, celebrate and reward the best disproportionately.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The sports analogy for compensation challenges the traditional corporate model where pay correlates more with seniority and proximity to transactions than with actual impact. The concept of "disproportionate impact" is the key link between athletics and smart creative work -- in both domains, the difference between good and great is not linear but exponential. This justifies compensation structures that mirror that exponential difference. The observation that what matters most in the Internet Century is product excellence (not proximity to transactions) calls for rewarding those closest to great products and innovations.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create compensation structures that allow for significant differentiation between good and exceptional performers. Pay the people closest to product excellence and innovation the most, regardless of title or tenure. Start compensation curves low to attract people motivated by the work itself, then reward disproportionately as performance proves out. Don't reward everyone equally like a Little League coach -- you're managing professionals, and equal rewards signal that performance differences don't matter.</p>
