      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Hurricane Katrina crisis response was a classic 20% project -- born from within a team, with no executive direction. The team launched thousands of up-to-the-minute satellite images that accurately showed the disaster scope and helped rescue workers navigate when signs and signal lights had been wiped out. It also helped agencies distribute relief supplies and aided survivors deciding whether to return home. Since Katrina, the 20% project became a full-time Crisis Response team in Google.org, helping people during natural disasters worldwide including the 2008 Chinese snowstorms and the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. Most team members don't get paid extra -- they are motivated by the work itself.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This story demonstrates how 20% time can create lasting organizational capabilities. What started as a spontaneous response evolved into a permanent team that builds on previous experience with each new disaster. The key is that the initial motivation was entirely intrinsic -- the team saw a need and had the capability to help. No business case was needed because the work was inherently meaningful. This is the ultimate expression of "focus on the user" -- when the user is someone whose life depends on your work, the motivation is unmistakable.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allow successful 20% projects to evolve into permanent capabilities when warranted. Look for opportunities where your company's unique capabilities can serve urgent humanitarian needs. Trust that intrinsically motivated teams will produce their best work without financial incentives. Build institutional knowledge that compounds with each new crisis or opportunity.</p>
