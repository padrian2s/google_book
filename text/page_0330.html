      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 168 explains the concept of "Pasteur's Quadrant," introduced by political scientist Donald Stokes, which uses Louis Pasteur as the exemplar of research that simultaneously pursues basic understanding and solves real-world problems. The quadrant represents a 2x2 matrix of whether research advances basic understanding and whether it addresses practical problems, with Pasteur's Quadrant being the ideal combination of both.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Pasteur's Quadrant provides a framework for the type of innovation the authors most value: work that advances fundamental knowledge while also solving practical problems. This connects to Google's approach of investing in deep technical research (like machine learning and distributed computing) that also directly powers products used by billions of people. The best innovations operate in both dimensions simultaneously.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Evaluate your research and development investments using the Pasteur's Quadrant framework. Prioritize projects that both advance your fundamental understanding of your domain and have clear potential for practical application. Avoid the trap of pursuing either pure research with no practical path or incremental product work that does not deepen your knowledge base.</p>
