      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Eric's golden rule of management: make sure you would work for yourself. The best tool is the self-review -- at least once per year, write a review of your own performance, then share it with people who work for you. This elicits greater insights than standard 360-degree reviews because initiating self-criticism gives others freedom to be honest. Eric's self-review candidly admitted failings like needing to empower the team earlier and force closure on decisions. The chapter then transitions to email wisdom, starting with nine personal rules for email communication.</p>

The self-review cuts through politeness bias in upward feedback. The transition to email rules acknowledges that in the Internet Century, communication skill is a core management competency.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Write an honest self-review annually and share it with direct reports. Be specific about failings -- vague self-criticism reads as false humility. Use the self-review as a conversation starter. Model the vulnerability you want to see in your organization's feedback culture.</p>
