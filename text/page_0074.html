      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The only way to get good at interviewing is to practice. Young people should take advantage of every opportunity to interview, but most prefer to spend time on things they think are more important. Getting people to interview is like pulling teeth. Not everyone will be good at it, so Google implemented a trusted-interviewer program -- an elite team of people who were actually good at interviewing and liked doing it. They did the bulk of the work and were rewarded with higher performance review scores. Product managers had to complete interview training and shadow four interviewers. They were scored on metrics including number of interviews, reliability, and quality and promptness of feedback (quality declines precipitously after 48 hours). Published stats let people "challenge" incumbents, making not interviewing a punishment rather than interviewing being a chore. Online photos and exuberant digital presence generally aren't held against candidates -- Google hires for passion, and passionate people have vibrant online lives.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The trusted-interviewer program solved a common organizational problem (everyone avoids interviewing) by creating elite status around the activity and tying it to performance evaluation. The gamification elements (published stats, challenge system) turned a dreaded chore into a competitive privilege. The 48-hour feedback quality cliff is a useful data point for any organization. The progressive stance on candidates' online presence reflects the authentic-passion hiring philosophy -- judging someone negatively for having a lively digital life would contradict the value placed on passionate engagement.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create a trusted-interviewer program with formal training, shadowing requirements, and performance metrics. Tie interviewing participation to performance reviews and promotions. Set a 48-hour deadline for interview feedback and measure compliance. Publish interviewing statistics to create healthy competition. Don't penalize candidates for having vibrant online lives -- this demonstrates passion and engagement with the digital world. Transform interviewing from a chore into a privilege by making exclusion from the program the penalty for poor performance.</p>
