      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (207) references Steve Chapman's Chicago Tribune article "Car Buyers Get Hijacked" (June 20, 2013), which discusses how regulations and entrenched industry practices harm consumers in the car-buying process -- an example of incumbents using regulation to protect their position against innovation.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The car-buying example illustrates the book's argument about how established industries use regulation as a barrier to innovation and disruption. When incumbents cannot compete on merit, they often turn to regulatory capture to maintain their position. This is the kind of obstacle that innovative companies like Tesla (with its direct-sales model) have had to fight against.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Be aware of regulatory barriers that protect incumbents at the expense of consumers and innovation. When building disruptive businesses, anticipate regulatory pushback and develop strategies to address it -- whether through advocacy, coalition-building, or creative compliance approaches.</p>
