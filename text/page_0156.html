      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>As Vinod Khosla points out, in 1980 it was hard to imagine microprocessors would be everywhere; in 1990, hard to imagine cell phones would be smaller than a deck of cards; in 1995, hard to imagine the Internet would have three billion users. We keep making the same mistake of underestimating technology's potential. The authors offer a series of hard questions to consider: How would a competitor attack your core business using digital platforms? What is the company doing to disrupt its own business? Is hiring a C-suite priority? Do decision-making processes lead to the best decisions or just acceptable ones? How much freedom do employees have? Who does better -- information hoarders or routers?</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The list of hard questions synthesizes the entire book's themes into a self-assessment framework. Questions about product focus, hiring priority, decision quality, employee freedom, and information flow correspond directly to the Culture, Talent, Decision-Making, and Communications chapters. The meta-question -- are you in the right place to attract the best smart creatives? -- acknowledges that physical location still matters enormously. Industry hubs have grown more powerful, not less, despite communications technology.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use the book's hard questions as a regular self-assessment for your organization. Evaluate whether you're located where the best talent for your industry wants to be. Ask whether your company leaders actually use and love your products. Force yourself to consider what happens if your customers' lock-in disappears. Check if decisions are optimized for quality or just consensus acceptability.</p>
