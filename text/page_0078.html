      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In the early 2000s, as Google added employees by the thousands, Eric, Larry, and Sergey noticed many newer hires were good but not as strong as needed. They couldn't control what every group was doing, but they could control whom they hired. Larry suggested senior management review every offer. The resulting hiring committee process, developed by Urs Holzle, entails a hierarchy of committees culminating with Larry, who for several years reviewed every offer personally. This was designed to optimize for quality, not efficiency or scale. The unit of currency is the hiring packet -- a comprehensive, standardized document containing all known candidate information. It must be stuffed with data, not opinion. You can't say "she's smart" without evidence -- you must provide data like "she's smart and has the MacArthur Fellowship to prove it."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Larry's personal review of every offer sent an unmistakable signal about hiring's importance to the company. The data-over-opinion mandate for hiring packets removes politics and personal advocacy from the process. The one-page summary with comprehensive supporting material mirrors good executive communication. The rule that only information in the packet gets considered prevents power plays and ensures transparency. The standardized template across all functions enables consistent evaluation. This system trades efficiency for quality -- a deliberate choice that reflects the belief that a bad hire costs far more than a slow hiring process.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create standardized hiring packets that compile all candidate data in a consistent format. Require every opinion to be supported by specific data or evidence. Make the packet the only source of information for the hiring committee -- no surprises or off-the-record advocacy. Design packets for quick review (120-second target) with a one-page summary and detailed supporting material. Include interviewer statistics (past scores, range, mean) so committee members can calibrate individual interviewer tendencies.</p>
