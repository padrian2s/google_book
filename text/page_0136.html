      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Creating a culture of yes requires structural support. In 2002, Sergey examined Google's top-100 project list and categorized projects into three buckets: about 70% related to core business (search and advertising), 20% related to emerging products with early success, and 10% involving completely new things with high risk but big payoff potential. This became the 70/20/10 rule for resource allocation. The rule ensures the core business always gets bulk resources while protecting crazy ideas from budget cuts. Ten percent isn't much, which is fine -- overinvesting in a new concept can be as problematic as underinvesting.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The 70/20/10 framework solves the structural problem of innovation in large organizations. Without it, the "culture of no" naturally emerges as managers protect their resources and avoid risk. The constraint on the 10% bucket is actually a feature: it forces creativity, prevents overinvestment that leads to confirmation bias (million-dollar ideas are harder to kill than thousand-dollar ones), and keeps moonshots from draining the core business. Jonathan's experience with Apple's Newton illustrates what happens when overinvestment in a flawed product makes it impossible to admit failure.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allocate resources explicitly: 70% to core, 20% to emerging, 10% to new bets. Protect the 10% from budget cuts -- these are your future. Keep new bets small to force creativity and make it easier to kill failures. Clean out your action folder every day as with email -- don't let overinvestment create confirmation bias about failing projects.</p>
