      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Board members want to talk about strategy and products, not governance and lawsuits. When Eric was on Siebel Systems' board, SEC violations dominated meetings and the business eroded as the board focused on legal matters instead of strategy. Administrivia can become a refuge from difficult business conversations. At Google, Eric committed to focusing board time on issues relevant to scale and strategy. The Apple board during Eric's time also did this well, with meetings full of great conversations about products, leadership, and strategy with clear leadership from Steve Jobs.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Siebel example illustrates how organizations can use process and compliance as avoidance mechanisms -- spending time on governance feels productive but can crowd out strategic discussions. Both Google and Apple demonstrated that world-class boards focus on product and strategy, handling legal and tactical matters in subcommittees. Any meeting can degenerate into administrivia when the hard conversations are uncomfortable.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Audit your board meeting agendas -- what percentage is strategy versus administrivia? Move governance and legal updates to subcommittees with 15-minute board-level summaries. If board meetings feel comfortable, you may not be discussing the hard topics. Establish early that strategy and products are the primary agenda, and defend that commitment even when compliance pressures mount.</p>
