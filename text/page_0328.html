      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 166 discusses why people fail to pursue their most ambitious ideas, citing expectancy-value theory from psychology. People weigh both expected payoff and odds of success when choosing goals, which often steers them away from the most ambitious pursuits. The note invokes Wayne Gretzky's famous quote that "you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take" and references research by Allan Wigfield, Jacquelynne Eccles, and others on achievement motivation.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors use psychological research to explain why most people and organizations default to incrementalism rather than pursuing transformative ideas. The rational calculation of expected value systematically biases against ambitious projects, creating a paradox where the safest-seeming strategy (avoiding big bets) actually increases long-term risk by preventing breakthrough innovation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Deliberately counteract the natural bias toward incrementalism in your organization. Create structures that reward ambitious thinking and protect people who take intelligent risks from the consequences of failure. Remember that the expected value calculation should account for asymmetric outcomes: while most ambitious bets may fail, the few that succeed can generate outsized returns that more than compensate for the failures.</p>
