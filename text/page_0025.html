      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Google went public in 2004, Larry and Sergey used the IPO as an opportunity to codify the company's values in a "letter from the founders" included in the prospectus. Inspired by Warren Buffett's annual Berkshire Hathaway letters, they wrote it themselves with input from a small group of Googlers. The SEC initially ruled it didn't contain investor-relevant information, but Google fought to include it. Bankers and lawyers tried to change the text, but Jonathan defended it because the founders wouldn't budge and everything in it was heartfelt and true. The letter's phrases -- "long term focus," "serving end users," "don't be evil," "making the world a better place" -- still guide the company a decade later. The founders understood that recording values for future employees would be far more valuable than optimizing short-term stock price.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Using major company milestones (like an IPO) as opportunities to codify and communicate values. The long-term value of documented values versus short-term financial optimization. The importance of founders writing their own values rather than delegating to lawyers or PR. The persistence of well-articulated values -- phrases from the 2004 letter still guide the company years later.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use significant company milestones to articulate and reinforce your values publicly. Write your own values statement -- don't delegate it to communications professionals. Defend your values against pressure to water them down for external audiences. Think of values documentation as an investment in long-term culture, not a marketing exercise.</p>
