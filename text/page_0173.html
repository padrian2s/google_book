      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Speed is another hopeful factor -- the latency between action and reaction is getting shorter. General purpose technologies like the steam engine took centuries to transform society; Netscape Navigator went from launch in 1994 to transforming communication in less than a decade. The advent of networks is giving rise to greater collective wisdom. When Garry Kasparov lost to IBM's Deep Blue in 1997, it seemed computers had surpassed humans at chess. But today's grandmasters sharpen their skills by collaborating with computers, creating a virtuous cycle of computer-aided intelligence.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The time from invention to societal transformation is compressing dramatically. Speed of disruption is an advantage for new ventures but terrifying for incumbents. Human-computer collaboration produces better results than either alone, as demonstrated in chess. The future belongs to augmented intelligence, not artificial intelligence replacing humans.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Expect disruption to happen faster than historical precedent suggests. Invest in human-computer collaboration rather than purely automated solutions. Use the acceleration of change as an advantage if you are building something new.</p>
