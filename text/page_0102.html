      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One of the most transformative developments of the Internet Century is the ability to quantify almost any aspect of business. Decisions once based on subjective opinion and anecdotes now rely on data. Companies aggregate anonymous mobile phone signals for real-time traffic data. London's water pipes are monitored by thousands of sensors, reducing leakage by 25 percent. Ranchers embed sensors in cattle that transmit 200 megabytes of data per year. John Dewey said "a problem well put is half solved," but in his time that meant an opinion and an anecdote. Now, as Berkeley professor Raymond Wolfinger observed, "the plural of anecdote is data." This is why most Google conference rooms have two projectors -- one for videoconferencing or meeting notes, the other for data. When discussing options, they start with data, seeking to convince by saying "Let me show you" rather than "I think."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The shift from opinion-based to data-based decision-making is presented as one of the Internet Century's most fundamental changes. The two-projector conference room is a powerful physical manifestation of this cultural value -- literally dedicating half the visual real estate to data. The progression from "I think" to "Let me show you" captures a philosophical shift in how arguments are made and decisions reached. The data bias also helps kill death-by-PowerPoint: slides should contain data, not words, and people presenting an argument shouldn't need slides as a crutch if their argument is sound.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Lead with data in meetings and decision-making discussions. Replace "I think" with "The data shows." Install a second screen in conference rooms dedicated to data display. Trust the people closest to the data (often not management) to interpret and present it. Use data to kill death-by-PowerPoint -- slides should display data, not text, and should complement discussion rather than replace it. When making financial decisions, focus on what matters: cash and revenue, not complex metrics.</p>
