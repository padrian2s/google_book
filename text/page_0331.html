The article describes DARPA's distinctive approach to tackling complex problems through small, elite teams with significant autonomy and clear missions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "special forces" metaphor for innovation teams resonates with the book's emphasis on small, empowered teams of smart creatives. DARPA's model -- where program managers have significant autonomy, limited tenure (creating urgency), and access to top talent -- mirrors the conditions the authors argue are necessary for breakthrough innovation in any organization.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Structure your most important innovation efforts as small, autonomous "special forces" teams with clear missions, tight deadlines, and empowered leaders. Give these teams the freedom to operate outside normal organizational processes when necessary, while maintaining accountability for outcomes. The combination of elite talent, urgency, and autonomy is a powerful formula for tackling hard problems.</p>
