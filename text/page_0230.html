      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 70 cites Ronald Coase's foundational paper "The Nature of the Firm" (Economica, November 1937). Coase asked why firms exist at all when markets could theoretically coordinate all economic activity. His answer -- transaction costs make it more efficient to organize some activities within firms -- is one of the most influential ideas in economics and directly relevant to the book's discussion of how the Internet is reducing transaction costs and changing optimal organizational structures.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Citing Coase's 1937 paper shows the authors building their argument about Internet-era organizational change on deep economic theory. The Internet dramatically reduces transaction costs, which according to Coase's theory should fundamentally change how firms are organized. An 80-year-old economic paper provides the framework for understanding 21st-century organizational design.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Understand how the Internet reduces transaction costs in your industry -- this directly affects whether activities should be done internally or outsourced. Redesign your organizational boundaries as transaction costs change; the optimal structure from five years ago may no longer be efficient. Use Coase's framework to evaluate build-vs-buy decisions: as external coordination becomes cheaper, the case for smaller, more focused organizations strengthens.</p>
