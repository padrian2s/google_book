      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Most companies let the hiring manager make the hiring decision. The problem is that the hiring manager will probably be the new employee's manager for only a year or two since organizations are fungible. In the most effective organizations, who you work for matters less than who you work with. Hiring decisions are too important to be left in the hands of one manager who may not have a stake in the employee's long-term success. Google set up a committee-based hiring process. The primary criterion for committee membership is objectivity -- being driven by what's best for the company, period. Committees should be four or five people with diversity in seniority, skills, and background. The hiring manager has veto power (can decide not to move a candidate forward) but not hiring power -- the committee decides based on data, not relationships.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Committee-based hiring removes the single point of failure in the hiring process -- the individual manager's biases, insecurities, and limited perspective. The veto-but-not-hiring power balance is elegant: it prevents bad fits from reaching the offer stage while preventing any one person from making a unilateral hire. The diversity requirement for committees (seniority, skills, background) ensures multiple perspectives evaluate each candidate. The fundamental insight is that collaborative work environments require collaborative hiring processes.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Move hiring decisions from individual managers to committees of four or five people. Ensure committee diversity across seniority, skills, and background. Give hiring managers veto power but not unilateral hiring authority. Apply the same committee-based approach to promotions -- they have company-wide impact and shouldn't be left to individual managers. Use committees to ensure people don't hire their friends, unless those friends happen to be superstars who would be hired regardless.</p>
