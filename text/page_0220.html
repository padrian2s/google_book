      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 60 provides a detailed account of how Google's ad quality approach defeated competitor Overture. Overture pioneered ad auctions but did not reward quality ads or penalize bad ones. Advertisers exploited this by placing irrelevant ads on unrelated searches for free impressions. Google's innovation was ranking ads by quality -- bad ads were not shown -- which led to better ads, more clicks, and a superior user experience.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Google won the ads market not by outspending competitors but by aligning incentives with quality -- a direct application of the "focus on the user" principle. Overture's system created perverse incentives that degraded quality over time; Google's system created virtuous cycles that improved quality. By prioritizing ad relevance for users, Google created a better experience for advertisers too.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design systems that create virtuous cycles -- where doing the right thing for users also generates the best business outcomes. Watch for perverse incentives in your marketplace or platform; systems that reward bad behavior will attract bad actors. Compete on quality and user experience rather than just price or reach.</p>
