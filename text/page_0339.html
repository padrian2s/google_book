This post related to Google Books' effort to estimate the total number of books ever published, arriving at approximately 130 million distinct titles.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Google Books project exemplifies the company's approach to "thinking big" -- attempting to organize and make accessible all the world's books is a quintessential moonshot project. The humorous framing of the blog post title also reflects Google's culture of making ambitious projects feel approachable and fun rather than grandiose.</p>
