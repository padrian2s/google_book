      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In 2004, Jonathan and Jeff Huber took Sergey to meet Keyhole, a startup that had developed cool ways to visualize and interact with maps. Sergey immediately decided Google should buy the company. When the board asked how they would make money from it, Sergey said "I'll let Jonathan answer that," and Jonathan had no answer. The board trusted Sergey's judgment. Eight months later, Google Earth launched as an immediate hit. Sundar Pichai realized people downloading Earth might also want Google Toolbar, which significantly increased Toolbar's user base and generated lots of revenue -- something no one could have predicted.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Keyhole/Google Earth story is a perfect example of "focus on the user and the money will follow" in action. The honest answer about monetization was "I have no idea... but I'm sure we'll figure it out." The revenue came from an unexpected connection (Earth downloads driving Toolbar adoption) that no financial analysis could have predicted. This vindicates the approach of trusting user value over upfront financial justification.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating acquisitions or new products, prioritize user value over immediate revenue models. Trust that great user experiences will eventually generate revenue, often in unexpected ways. Be honest when you don't know how something will make money -- "we'll figure it out" can be the right answer when the user value is clear. Create connections between products that amplify each other's value.</p>
