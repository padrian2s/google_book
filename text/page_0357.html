      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (195) references Steven Levy's Wired article "Jeff Bezos Owns the Web in More Ways Than You Think" (November 13, 2011), which explored the many dimensions of Amazon's influence on the internet beyond just retail, including cloud computing, digital content, and platform services.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Bezos and Amazon illustrates the book's theme about platform thinking. Amazon's success came not just from selling products online but from building platforms (AWS, Marketplace, Kindle) that others could build upon. This is the kind of strategic vision the authors advocate: thinking in terms of platforms and ecosystems rather than individual products.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating your business strategy, consider whether you are building products or platforms. Platforms create exponentially more value because they enable others to create value on top of them. Study Amazon's evolution from online bookstore to multi-platform company as a model for strategic thinking.</p>
