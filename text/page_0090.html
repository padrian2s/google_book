      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Career development takes effort and forethought -- you need to plan it. Yet astonishingly many people who come to Google for career advice have failed to do even basic career planning. Jonathan gives them career exercises accompanied by Tom Lehrer's line: "Life is like a sewer: What you get out of it depends on what you put into it." Steps to creating a plan: Think about your ideal job five years from now -- not today but five years out. Where do you want to be? What do you want to do? How much do you want to make? Write the job description as it would appear on a website. Then fast-forward to that job and write your five-years-from-now resume. What path did you take? Assess your strengths and weaknesses against that ideal, getting external input from managers and peers. Determine training and experience needed. If your conclusion is that you're ready for your ideal job today, you aren't thinking big enough -- start over and make it a stretch.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The career planning framework mirrors the strategy approach from the earlier chapter: start with the future and work backward. Writing the ideal job description and reverse-engineering the resume path creates a concrete, actionable plan from what might otherwise be vague aspiration. The "if you're ready today, think bigger" advice prevents complacency and ensures the plan drives genuine growth. The emphasis on external input for self-assessment acknowledges the blind spots inherent in self-evaluation. As Yogi Berra said: "You've got to be careful if you don't know where you're going, 'cause you might not get there."</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Write your ideal job description for five years from now and your future resume showing the path to get there. Get honest feedback from managers and peers about your strengths and weaknesses relative to that goal. Identify specific training, experiences, and skills you need to develop. If the ideal job feels achievable today, you're not thinking ambitiously enough. Revisit this plan regularly and adjust as your career evolves and new opportunities emerge.</p>
