      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 40 explains the Scopes Trial of 1925, in which Clarence Darrow defended high-school teacher John Scopes for teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law. Darrow argued that the Biblical "days" of creation might not have been twenty-four hours long, so evolution was not incompatible with the Bible. The authors use this historical reference to illustrate a point about intellectual debate and challenging established orthodoxies.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Scopes Trial parallels the book's theme that innovation requires questioning established beliefs, even when they are widely accepted. The authors show awareness of their global readership by noting "in case you dozed off that day in American history class, or grew up elsewhere." Darrow's legal strategy of reinterpreting "days" demonstrates the creative reframing the authors value.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Challenge assumptions that seem unquestionable -- breakthrough thinking often comes from reframing established beliefs. When communicating, do not assume shared cultural knowledge; explain references to ensure inclusivity.</p>
