      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Eric joined Google, he was aware of the troubled history of hired CEOs clashing with founders. Steve Jobs hiring John Sculley at Apple in 1983 is the classic cautionary tale. To avoid this, Eric decided he would let Larry and Sergey do what they did best while he focused on building the company's operational capacity. The IPO letter described their roles: Eric focused on VP management and sales, Sergey on engineering and business deals, Larry on engineering and product management, and they met daily. This worked well when all three agreed, which was most of the time. When they disagreed, Eric's process was: identify the issue, have the argument with just the three of them, set a deadline, and often add a corollary -- let the founders decide. The CEO's tendency, especially in a founder-led company, is to try to make too big an impact. A key skill is knowing which decisions to make and which to let run their course.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "make fewer decisions" principle is counterintuitive for leaders who equate authority with decision-making. Eric's approach of deferring to founders on product and engineering while focusing on operational scale shows sophisticated understanding of comparative advantage in leadership. The daily meeting cadence between the three leaders enabled rapid conflict resolution without formal bureaucracy. The anecdote about the founders disagreeing with each other (and then coming up with a new, better idea overnight) demonstrates how creative tension between smart people can produce solutions none of them envisioned individually.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>As a leader, resist the urge to weigh in on every decision. Focus your decision-making energy on the areas where you have the most impact: product launches, acquisitions, public policy issues. Let other capable leaders make decisions in their domains, intervening only when you know they're making a serious mistake. When working with co-leaders, establish clear lanes of responsibility and meet frequently to resolve conflicts quickly. Set deadlines for disagreements and let the people closest to the issue decide.</p>
