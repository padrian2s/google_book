      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>A person who passes the LAX/Googleyness test is someone you could have an interesting conversation with, but that doesn't mean you have to like them. Imagine being stuck at LAX with someone who is your polar opposite politically -- if they're your equal in intellect, creativity, and Googleyness, you'd still have a provocative conversation, and your company would be better off having both of you. You must work with people you don't like, because a workforce of "best office buddies" becomes homogeneous, and homogeneity breeds failure. Diversity of viewpoints is your best defense against myopia. From a corporate standpoint, diversity in hiring is even more important than the moral argument -- people from different backgrounds see the world differently, generating insights that can't be taught. Great talent often doesn't look or act like you.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The argument for diversity is made on both moral and business grounds, with the business case being emphasized as "even more emphatically the right thing to do." The insight about homogeneity breeding failure is a direct connection to the earlier strategy themes -- if everyone thinks alike, you'll miss disruptive threats and opportunities. The phrase "insight that can't be taught" elevates diversity from a compliance checkbox to a strategic capability. Managing performance through data-driven, empirical methods rather than subjective impressions is presented as the complement to diverse hiring.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Check your biases at the interview door and focus on passion, intellect, and character regardless of background. Don't hire for likability -- hire for the ability to generate insights and challenge thinking. Build diverse teams deliberately, seeking variety in background, perspective, and thinking style. Create empirical, objective methods to measure performance so that diverse teams are evaluated fairly. Recognize that the discomfort of working with people who think differently is actually a feature, not a bug.</p>
