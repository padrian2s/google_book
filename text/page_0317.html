      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 155 cites a Wall Street Journal article by Leslie Kwoh titled "You Call That Innovation?" from May 2012, which reported the exact count of 33,528 -- likely referring to the number of times the word "innovation" appeared in corporate communications, highlighting how overused and diluted the term had become in the business world.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors use this data point to critique the gap between talking about innovation and actually practicing it. Many companies claim to be innovative while simply using the word as marketing language. This connects to the book's core argument that real innovation requires specific organizational structures, cultures, and leadership practices -- not just rhetoric.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Focus on building the conditions for innovation rather than simply talking about it. Measure innovation by outputs -- new products, improved user experiences, breakthrough technologies -- not by how often the word appears in your corporate communications. Actions and results speak louder than slogans.</p>
