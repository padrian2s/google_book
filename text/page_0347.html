      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (185) references a quote from Linus Pauling, as cited in Tom Hager's biography "Linus Pauling and the Chemistry of Life." Pauling, a two-time Nobel Prize winner, was famous for emphasizing that the way to have good ideas is to have lots of ideas and then throw away the bad ones.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Pauling reinforces the book's argument that innovation is a numbers game. The best way to find breakthrough ideas is not to carefully deliberate on a single path, but to generate many ideas and ruthlessly cull the weak ones. This connects to Google's approach of encouraging experimentation and accepting that most attempts will fail.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create environments where generating many ideas is encouraged and where discarding bad ideas carries no stigma. Volume of ideation, combined with rigorous evaluation, is more productive than trying to produce only perfect ideas from the start.</p>
