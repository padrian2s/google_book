      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Even with the best retention efforts, some top people will consider leaving for greener pastures. When this happens, focus retention on the stars, leaders, and innovators (not necessarily the same people), and do whatever it takes to keep them. Their loss creates a ripple effect since followers often leave too. Because people seldom leave over compensation alone, the first step is to listen -- they want to be heard, to be relevant and valued. In retention conversations, be the advocate of the person, not the organization. Help them take a longer-term perspective: How could staying position them for greater success later? Have they considered the financial ramifications? Help them find ways to recharge while staying. If they want to start something, ask for their elevator pitch. If they can't articulate a good strategic foundation, culture vision, and investor pitch, they obviously aren't ready. Advise them to keep developing the idea while contributing, and when they can convince you to invest, let them go with best wishes.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The retention framework is remarkably nuanced: advocate for the person (not the organization), help them think clearly about their decision, and if they're not ready to leave, give them a constructive path forward. The elevator pitch test for aspiring entrepreneurs is both a retention tool and genuine career coaching. The "hard-to-resist offer" (keep working while developing your idea, and we'll support you when you're ready) is psychologically sophisticated -- it removes the urgency of departure while demonstrating genuine care for the person's long-term success.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When a key person wants to leave, listen first and understand their motivation before making counteroffers. Be their advocate, not the company's salesperson. For aspiring entrepreneurs, use the elevator pitch test to assess readiness and offer a path that lets them develop their idea while staying. When someone has a competing offer, act quickly (within an hour) if you want to counter. If it's truly in their best interest to go, let them go gracefully and welcome them into your alumni network. Remember Reid Hoffman's advice: "Just because a job ends, your relationship doesn't have to."</p>
