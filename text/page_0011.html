      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Jonathan presented Larry Page with a textbook gate-based product plan featuring milestones, approvals, priorities, and a two-year roadmap. Larry's response was devastating: "Have you ever seen a scheduled plan that the team beat?" and "Have your teams ever delivered better products than what was in the plan?" The answer to both was no. Larry's directive was simple: "Just go talk to the engineers." Jonathan realized these weren't traditional engineers -- they were brilliant coders with business savvy and creativity, given unusual freedom and power by the academic-minded founders. Managing them through traditional planning structures would hem them in. When the board then asked for a traditional business plan, Eric and Jonathan were caught in the middle -- satisfying the board while preserving what made Google work.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The failure of gate-based product development in fast-moving environments -- plans become ceilings, not floors. The insight that traditional management structures constrain rather than enable talented people. The "stuck in the middle" dilemma leaders face between institutional expectations and operational reality. The founders' instinctive understanding that empowered engineers would outperform any prescribed plan.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Question whether your planning processes are serving as ceilings that limit what teams can achieve. When talented people consistently meet but never exceed plans, the problem is likely the planning process itself. Talk directly to the people doing the work rather than relying on management intermediaries. Recognize that the best approach for managing creative, talented people is often to remove obstacles rather than prescribe paths.</p>
