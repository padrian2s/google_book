      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Technology has disrupted businesses even more than consumers. When cost curves shift downward on primary factors of production (information, connectivity, computing power), entire industries face upheaval. Incumbents built on assumptions of scarcity -- scarce information, distribution, choice -- find their barriers to entry eliminated. Product excellence has become paramount because consumers are better informed and have more choice than ever. Restaurant chains that once thrived on marketing alone now face competition from locally owned places with word-of-mouth driven by online reviews. The same pattern applies across all industries. Jeff Bezos captures it: in the old world, 30% building and 70% shouting; in the new world, that inverts.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The shift from distribution-controlled markets to quality-controlled markets. The death of "adequate products with overwhelming marketing." The transparency effect -- consumers now have access to quality information from both professional and citizen reviewers. The pattern of incumbents believing they can "out-market" superior products, as illustrated by Excite@Home's failed strategy against Google. Even Google's own mediocre products (Notebook, Knol, iGoogle, Wave, Buzz) died despite the company's brand power.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Invest disproportionately in product quality rather than marketing spend. Recognize that in the Internet Century, brand and marketing cannot compensate for an inferior product. Monitor customer reviews and online sentiment as early warning systems. Accept that even strong brands cannot save mediocre products -- be willing to kill underperforming offerings quickly.</p>
