      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 59 describes the PageRank algorithm, the foundational technology on which Google Search was built. Named after Larry Page, it was described in the 1999 Stanford InfoLab Technical Report by Lawrence Page, Sergey Brin, Rajeev Motwani, and Terry Winograd. The algorithm treated web links as citations, ranking pages by the quality and quantity of pages linking to them.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>PageRank exemplifies the book's theme that great companies are built on genuine technical innovation, not just business model innovation. Google's core technology originated as academic research, illustrating the value of the university-to-startup pipeline. The PageRank insight -- using link structure as a quality signal -- was deceptively simple yet transformative.</p>
