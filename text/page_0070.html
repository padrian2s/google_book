      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In 2003, Google interviewed about fifty candidates for head of human resources. Many had traditional experience but none fit what the company needed -- they were growing faster than perhaps any other company in history and needed executives who could build scalable engines. Eric blurted out "Find me a Rhodes scholar who is also an astrophysicist." After deciding astrophysicists wouldn't come to Google to be business executives, Sergey said "get me a law partner." One candidate wrote a brilliant, funny contract (selling Sergey's soul to the devil) but wasn't technical enough. Their search partner suggested a McKinsey partner and Rhodes scholar, leading to Shona Brown, who had never held a similar role but succeeded brilliantly. When they needed a new CFO in 2008, Eric asked Martha to "find another Shona Brown" -- she found Patrick Pichette, another Rhodes scholar and McKinsey partner. Sergey even offered jobs to all Rhodes scholars at a London event.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Shona Brown story is the expanded aperture principle taken to its logical extreme -- hiring someone with zero direct experience for one of the most important roles in the company, based entirely on intellectual caliber and learning ability. The "find another Shona Brown" formula shows how successful aperture expansion creates reusable hiring templates. Sergey's instinct to offer jobs to all Rhodes scholars at the London event (seemingly crazy but actually logical) demonstrates the most extreme version of hiring for raw talent over specific experience.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When traditional candidate profiles aren't yielding results, radically rethink what success in the role actually requires. Look for proxies of excellence (Rhodes scholars, proven intellectual achievement) rather than direct experience. Accept that expanding the aperture brings higher start-up costs and some failures -- hiring a brilliant but inexperienced person costs more initially than hiring someone experienced. But hiring brilliant generalists is far better for the company in the long run.</p>
