      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In the summer of 2004, Google engineer Kevin Gibbs came up with a system to perform real-time query completion. Working in his spare time, he developed a prototype and shared it via email. This became Google Suggest, now used by billions of people worldwide. This is the power of 20 percent time -- the Google program letting engineers spend 20% of their time on whatever they choose. It has spawned Google Now, Google News, transit information on Maps, and many more products. But it is generally misunderstood: it's not about time, it's about freedom. In practice, 20% time is more like 120% time, often done on nights and weekends.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Twenty percent time is fundamentally a check on imperial managers and a way to give people permission to work on things they aren't supposed to. It brings to life Steve Jobs's maxim that organizations should be "run by ideas, not hierarchy." The policy works because when you trust people with freedom, they generally don't waste it on extravagant pursuits -- they write code. The Street View trike, which started as a 20% project to navigate Barcelona's narrow alleyways, has since been adapted to snowmobiles and museum pushcarts.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Give employees formal permission to pursue passion projects. Trust that freedom will be used productively. Recognize that 20% time is really about autonomy, not scheduling -- the best projects happen because someone cares deeply, often beyond normal hours. Use it as a check on managers who might otherwise prevent good ideas from emerging.</p>
