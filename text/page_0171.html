      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>There are solid reasons for technology optimism. The first is the explosion of data and a trend toward free flow of information. From geological sensors to wearable technology like Google's smart contact lenses that track vital signs, types of data never before available are being collected at unprecedented scale. Practically limitless computing power exists to analyze this data. Infinite data and infinite computing power create an amazing playground for smart creatives to solve big problems.</p>
