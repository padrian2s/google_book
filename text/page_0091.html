      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Stats are sexy. The sexiest jobs in the Internet Century will involve statistics, and not just in a geeky fantasy world. Hal Varian notes it's always good to build expertise in areas that complement things getting cheap -- and data, along with computing power to crunch it, is definitely getting cheap. We are in the era of big data, and big data needs statisticians. Data is the sword of the twenty-first century, and those who wield it well are the samurai. Even if you're "not a numbers person," there is hope: asking the right questions and interpreting the answers is as important as coming up with them. No matter your business, learning to use data correctly will help you make better decisions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "statistics is the new plastics" reference to The Graduate's famous career advice scene positions data literacy as the universal career skill of the Internet Century. Hal Varian's complementary skills insight is a powerful economic principle: as data and computing become cheap, the ability to analyze and interpret them becomes proportionally more valuable. The reassurance to non-numbers people that question-asking is as valuable as number-crunching democratizes data literacy beyond traditional quantitative roles.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Invest in developing your statistical and data analysis skills regardless of your role. If you're not naturally quantitative, focus on learning to ask the right questions of data and interpret others' analyses. Build expertise in areas that complement cheapening technology -- data analysis, machine learning fundamentals, and evidence-based decision-making. Learn which questions to ask the quantitative people on your team and how to best use their insights. Start sharpening that data sword.</p>
