      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 52 cites Louis V. Gerstner Jr.'s Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?: Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround (HarperBusiness, 2002), page 183. Gerstner's account of transforming IBM from a struggling giant into a competitive force is one of the most celebrated corporate turnaround stories, relevant to the book's discussion of how large organizations can regain agility.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Gerstner proved that even massive, bureaucratic organizations can be revitalized -- a counterpoint to the assumption that only startups can be innovative. Gerstner famously said "culture isn't just one aspect of the game -- it is the game," directly supporting the book's emphasis on culture.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Do not assume that organizational size prevents transformation -- with the right leadership and cultural changes, even large companies can become agile. Prioritize culture change as the foundation of any strategic transformation, not an afterthought.</p>
