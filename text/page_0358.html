      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (196) references Regina E. Dugan and Kaigham J. Gabriel's Harvard Business Review article "'Special Forces' Innovation: How DARPA Attacks Problems" (October 2013). The article examines DARPA's distinctive approach to tackling ambitious, high-risk research challenges through small, elite teams with clear missions and tight timelines.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>DARPA's model of innovation -- small teams, big ambitions, tight deadlines, and tolerance for failure -- mirrors many of the principles the book advocates for Google and other technology companies. The "special forces" metaphor emphasizes quality over quantity in team composition, a theme that runs throughout the Talent chapter of the book.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>For breakthrough innovation, consider assembling small, dedicated teams with clear mandates and aggressive timelines. Remove bureaucratic barriers and give these teams the autonomy to operate like special forces -- fast, focused, and empowered to make decisions without excessive oversight.</p>
