      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>To understand why change threatens traditional corporations, look at history. The preindustrial nineteenth-century institution was The Household (as depicted in Downton Abbey). After the industrial revolution, The Corporation became dominant -- think General Motors with mass production, blue-collar labor, and comfortable middle-class lifestyles. In the twenty-first century, The Corporation is being challenged by The Platform. A platform like Amazon has a back-and-forth relationship with consumers and suppliers -- consumers have a voice, can rate products, and tell the platform what they want. This is fundamentally different from the one-way relationship of traditional corporations.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The historical progression from Household to Corporation to Platform shows how each era's dominant economic institution reflects its underlying technology. The Corporation thrived with mass production and physical infrastructure. The Platform thrives with digital infrastructure and network effects. The critical shift is from one-way (corporation dictates to consumers) to two-way (platform and consumers co-create value). This has profound implications for every industry that still operates on the corporate model.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Evaluate whether your business model is a corporation or a platform -- and consider which it needs to become. Create two-way relationships with your users where they contribute value, not just consume it. Study platform businesses like Amazon to understand how they create value differently from traditional corporations. Recognize that the transition from Corporation to Platform is as significant as the transition from Household to Corporation.</p>
