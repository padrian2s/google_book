      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>With Android, Google bet on the superior economics of an open platform. The source code is available for free under the Apache license -- anyone can take the OS and do what they want with it. Android is growing and expanding in unexpected ways: electronic readers, tablets, game players, phones, refrigerators, treadmills, TVs, and toys. Apple represents the opposite approach -- iOS code is closed and apps must receive Apple's formal approval. Steve believed the best consumer experience comes from maintaining complete control. Apple's control model works because of Jobs's excellence and because Apple's leaders are product people with technical backgrounds.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The open vs. closed debate in innovation reflects deeper strategic choices about control and ecosystems. Open platforms sacrifice control for broader adoption and unexpected innovation from the community. Closed platforms sacrifice breadth for quality and consistency. The authors note that whenever someone uses Steve Jobs as a counterexample to their principles, they respond: "if you are the equal of Steve Jobs, go ahead and try it his way." The implication is that the controlled model requires extraordinary talent at the top, while open models are more robust to varying leadership quality.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Consider an open platform strategy when you want to maximize adoption and ecosystem growth. Choose a controlled approach only when you can guarantee exceptional quality at every level. Be honest about whether your leadership has the extraordinary taste and vision required for a Steve Jobs-style controlled model. For most companies, the open approach provides more sustainable innovation.</p>
