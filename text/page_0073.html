      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When asking about a candidate's background, ask questions that allow expression of insights rather than regurgitation of experiences. "What surprised you about...?" works because it's different enough to avoid rehearsed responses. Scenario questions are helpful for senior candidates because they reveal whether someone is a "do it yourself" type or someone who trusts and relies on their team. Generic answers to these questions indicate a generic candidate who won't think deeply about things. Then there are Google's infamous brainteasers -- the company has largely phased these out. Many questions and answers ended up online, so continuing to use them tested research ability more than reasoning. The brainteasers also became a lightning rod for criticism as elitist. Google acknowledges wanting to hire the best minds available and separating great from good, but concedes that brainteasers weren't always the best way to do that.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The evolution away from brainteasers represents organizational learning -- Google was willing to abandon a signature practice when data showed it wasn't effective. The distinction between questions that test reasoning versus those that test research ability is important for any interviewing methodology. The unapologetic stance on elitism in hiring ("we want to hire the best minds available") paired with willingness to improve methods shows intellectual honesty about the tension between aspiration and execution.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design interview questions that test genuine thinking ability rather than preparation or research skills. Identify candidates who ask good questions themselves -- curiosity, flexibility, and awareness of limitations are smart creative characteristics. Remember that the interviewee is evaluating you too -- don't waste the first minutes on small talk when the candidate has multiple offers. Practice interviewing to improve -- it's a skill that develops with repetition, not just theory.</p>
