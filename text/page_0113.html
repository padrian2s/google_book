      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors share personal rules for email: (1) Respond quickly to everyone, creating a positive feedback loop. (2) Every word matters -- be crisp and eliminate unnecessary words, following Elmore Leonard's advice to "leave out the parts people skip." (3) Clean out your inbox constantly using the OHIO principle (Only Hold It Once). (4) Handle email in LIFO order. (5) Be a router -- forward useful information. (6) Avoid bcc -- it is counterproductive in a transparent culture; copy people openly or not at all.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Quick responsiveness reinforces flat, meritocratic culture. The emphasis on crisp writing reflects a broader principle: communication overhead is a significant drag in high-velocity organizations. The OHIO inbox principle applies lean manufacturing concepts to personal productivity. The anti-bcc rule directly ties email behavior to cultural values of transparency.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Respond to most emails within hours, even with just "got it." Draft emails, then edit them to half their length. Process your inbox to zero daily. Eliminate bcc from your habits. At the end of each day, ask "What should I have forwarded but didn't?"</p>
