      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>After picking the industry, pick the company by listening for people who truly get technology -- genius-level smart creatives who see where technology is going before everyone else. Bill Gates and Paul Allen saw cheap computers would make software key, so they started Microsoft. Chad Hurley saw cheap video cameras and bandwidth would transform entertainment, cofounding YouTube. Reid Hoffman knew the web's connecting power would be vital for professionals, starting LinkedIn. Marc Benioff believed software would live in the cloud, founding Salesforce. Steve Jobs foresaw computers as consumer accessories decades before the market caught up. How do you know if someone gets it? Look at their history -- they're often playing with technology long before they think of it as a career. Reid Hoffman got his first job at age twelve by presenting product improvements to a game developer. Marc Benioff sold his first program at fifteen. Larry Page built a printer from Legos.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "people who get technology" are identified by their ability to see the future implications of current technology trends before those implications become obvious. The common thread among all the examples is that these visionaries were deeply engaged with technology from childhood -- it's not something they chose as a career path but rather an innate fascination they eventually channeled professionally. These are the people who navigate the best waves in the best places. Finding them and attaching yourself to their vision is presented as a career strategy for those who may not be visionaries themselves but can recognize vision in others.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating companies to join, look for leaders who have a deep, instinctive understanding of technology trends -- not just business acumen applied to tech. Look at founders' and leaders' histories: were they tinkering with technology before it was their job? Seek out people who may not be well known but brim with insights about where technology is heading. Find them, hook in, and hang on. These technology-native leaders will navigate to the biggest waves.</p>
