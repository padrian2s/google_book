      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The "These Ads Suck" story illustrates culture's power: it wasn't Google's culture that turned those engineers into problem-solving ninjas, but culture that attracted them in the first place. Smart creatives place culture at the top of their job criteria, above role, compensation, and even track record. The authors argue culture is the most important thing to consider when starting a company. Most companies let culture happen by accident, but failed cultural experiments are costly because culture is extremely hard to change once established -- self-selection means people who share existing values are drawn in while others stay away. The smart approach is to define culture at the outset by asking your core team: What do we care about? What do we believe? Who do we want to be?</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Culture as a talent magnet -- the right culture attracts the right people automatically. The self-selection feedback loop that makes culture self-reinforcing but also resistant to change. The danger of letting culture develop by accident rather than by design. The distinction between authentic culture (lived daily) and performative culture (mission statements written by HR or PR). The critical window at company founding when culture is most malleable.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Define your culture deliberately at the very beginning of your venture, not after you've succeeded. Involve your core founding team in articulating values -- don't delegate this to HR or communications. Test your cultural values with a simple question: if we changed these, would anyone notice or care? Write values that are specific enough to guide real decisions, not generic platitudes that could apply to any company.</p>
