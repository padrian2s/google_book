      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Governments have important decisions to make. They can stand with incumbents trying to stave off change, or they can choose to encourage disruption and create environments where smart creatives thrive. It starts with education -- not just traditional K-12 and university formats, but customized, flexible, lifelong education. Digital infrastructure is a must-have, and immigration-friendly policy is critical for innovation. Most importantly, governments need to protect the freedom to innovate. Regulations should not anticipate everything and leave no room for innovation. For example, Tesla faces regulatory roadblocks preventing direct sales to consumers, and self-driving cars will eventually face similar challenges.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The government section addresses a systemic factor that individual companies cannot control alone. Incumbents naturally try to use regulatory power to prevent disruption, and they often have more money and political influence than disruptors. The tension between protecting public safety and enabling innovation is real -- when a self-driving car causes an accident, the response should be data-driven regulation, not reflexive prohibition. The principle applies broadly: if data empirically shows a new way is better, government's role is to allow the disruption, not prevent it.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Engage with policymakers to advocate for innovation-friendly regulation. Support education reform that creates flexible, lifelong learning pathways. Push for open digital infrastructure and immigration policies that attract global talent. When regulation threatens innovation, respond with data showing the superiority of the new approach rather than simply opposing all regulation.</p>
