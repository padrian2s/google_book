      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In late 1999, John Doerr gave a presentation at Google about OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), which he had learned from Intel CEO Andy Grove. OKRs differ from typical corporate objectives in several ways: they marry big-picture objectives with highly measurable key results; good OKRs should be a stretch to achieve, with 100% on all OKRs being practically unattainable (70% is often better); nearly everyone does them; they are scored but the scoring isn't used for evaluation; and they are reserved for areas needing special focus, not business-as-usual activities.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>OKRs institutionalize "think big" culture. If all your OKRs are green, you aren't setting them high enough. The strange arithmetic where 70% on a great OKR beats 100% on a lesser one prevents the typical corporate game of sandbagging objectives to look good. The fact that scores aren't tracked for evaluation lets people be honest about their performance. As companies grow, the most important OKRs shift from individuals to teams, maintaining focus on big tasks that require collaboration.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Implement OKRs that pair ambitious objectives with measurable key results. Set goals so high that hitting 100% on everything means you weren't ambitious enough. Don't tie OKR scores to compensation or evaluation -- that kills honest goal-setting. Reserve OKRs for stretch objectives, not routine work. Use OKRs to keep people focused on ambitious goals rather than chasing competitors.</p>
