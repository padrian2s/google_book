      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 50 notes that Google announced it was selling Motorola to Lenovo in 2014. This brief update provides context for the book's discussion of Google's acquisition and subsequent divestiture of Motorola Mobility, a strategic move that involved acquiring Motorola's patent portfolio while ultimately deciding the hardware business did not fit Google's core strategy.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Google's willingness to reverse a major acquisition decision demonstrates the kind of decisive, data-driven strategic thinking the book advocates. The Motorola episode shows that even the best companies make acquisitions that do not work out -- what matters is how quickly they recognize and correct course.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Be willing to reverse strategic decisions when evidence shows they are not working -- the sunk cost fallacy can trap organizations in failing strategies. Evaluate acquisitions honestly and regularly; the courage to divest is as important as the vision to acquire.</p>
