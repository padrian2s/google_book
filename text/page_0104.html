      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The conflict-based consensus approach works only if managed by a single decision-maker who owns the deadline and will break ties. Often there is too much data, or data is inconclusive. The decision-maker's most important duty is to set a deadline, run the process, then enforce it -- like a bell at recess. Bill Campbell told a story about an important product decision at Intuit that had stalled. The executive kept ordering more research, feeding at the data trough. Bill ordered a stop: "Do something, even if it's wrong." Tom Peters called this a "bias for action," and the Stanford design school promotes a hands-on, trial-and-error mindset. But some behavioral economists warn that bias for action can favor hasty decisions. Eric's "PIA" rule for negotiations: Patience, Information, and Alternatives -- wait as long as possible before committing. Soccer goalies who simply wait (instead of diving early) double their save rate on penalty kicks.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The tension between "bias for action" and "patience" is resolved by understanding timing as the decision-maker's core skill. The recess bell metaphor is apt: let people debate freely within bounds, then enforce the deadline. The goalie analogy adds nuance -- sometimes doing nothing is the best action until you have enough information. The synthesis is that good decision-making requires both urgency (don't analyze forever) and patience (don't decide prematurely). The decision-maker must develop the skill to sense when analysis is no longer productive and action is needed.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Always assign a single decision-maker for important decisions. Set explicit deadlines for decisions and enforce them. Develop the judgment to know when more analysis will help versus when it's just delaying the inevitable. In negotiations, practice PIA: gather more information, develop more alternatives, and wait as long as possible before committing. But when the bell rings, make the call decisively and move the team to rally around implementation.</p>
