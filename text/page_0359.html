      <h4>Summary</h4>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The humor in comparing an adult professional to a toddler highlights a serious point: the qualities that make toddlers exhausting -- endless curiosity, refusal to accept superficial answers, willingness to try things even when they might fail -- are exactly the qualities that drive innovation. The best smart creatives retain this childlike drive to understand and experiment.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Encourage a culture of relentless questioning. When someone asks "why?" five times in a row, they are not being difficult -- they are getting to root causes. Foster the toddler-like qualities of curiosity and persistence in your teams, even when it feels uncomfortable.</p>
