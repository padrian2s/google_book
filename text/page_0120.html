      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In hierarchical organizations, figuring out who to talk to is easy -- follow the org chart. But the steady state of a successful Internet Century venture is chaos. When Eric was CEO at Novell, the company ran like a well-oiled machine, but the new-product cupboard was bare. As Mario Andretti said, "If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough." The business should always outrun its processes, and in that environment the only way to get things done is through relationships. Eric believes in the three-week rule: spend the first three weeks in a new position just listening, understanding issues, and earning trust.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This inverts conventional management wisdom. Most organizations strive for order and predictability, but the authors argue chaos is desirable -- it means business is growing faster than processes can keep up. In such environments, formal structures break down and relationships become the primary mechanism for getting things done. The three-week rule acknowledges that relationship-building is genuine work, even when it doesn't produce visible output.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>If your organization feels perfectly organized, worry -- you may have stopped innovating. When starting a new role, resist acting immediately; spend weeks building relationships first. Record personal details about colleagues. Use praise generously when deserved -- it is underused and underappreciated as a management tool.</p>
