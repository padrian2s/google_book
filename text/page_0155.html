      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Vic Gundotra got started on his social quest by asking himself the hardest questions: What would it mean to Google when the dominant use of the web was social? Could the social web make search obsolete? Sometimes the most effective way to drive change is simply to ask the hardest question. When Eric worked at Sun in the 1990s, the hardest question was what would happen when Wintel price-performance surpassed Sun's. When he posed this to the CEO, their conclusion was that Sun could never compete -- but nobody took substantive action. By 2006, Windows servers had taken over and Sun's market share languished. Sun was sold to Oracle in 2009 for $7.4 billion, down from $141 billion market cap in 2000.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Hard questions often don't get asked because the answers make people uncomfortable. But as Eric learned at Sun, it's better for discomfort to come from friendly fire than from a competitor intent on killing you. If there aren't good answers, that's actually a silver lining -- those hardest questions with no easy answers are very effective at mitigating the risk-averse tendencies of big-company culture. Larry Page says the job of a CEO is to think about not just the core business but also the future, and the question to ask isn't what will be true but what could be true.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Regularly ask yourself what could be true in five years -- not what will be, but what could be. Identify the hardest question facing your business and force the team to confront it. Don't accept comfortable answers. If the answer reveals an existential threat, take substantive action immediately rather than hoping the threat will pass. Use hard questions to attract the best talent who are drawn to honest challenges.</p>
