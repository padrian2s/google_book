      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 31 briefly describes PERT charts and Gantt charts as "hideously complex and highly useful tools of the project management trade." This aside reflects the authors' characteristic humor about the sometimes overwhelming complexity of traditional management tools.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors acknowledge that effective management tools can be complex while maintaining a light tone, consistent with Google's culture of not taking things too seriously. Despite the complexity, the tools are described as "highly useful" -- the authors value practical effectiveness over simplicity for its own sake.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Do not avoid useful tools simply because they are complex -- invest the time to learn tools that genuinely improve project management outcomes. Balance the overhead of formal project management methodologies with the agility needed in fast-moving environments.</p>
