      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors describe how traditional staff meetings reinforce organizational silos.

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The trip report practice serves multiple purposes: it makes meetings interesting, gets people out of their functional rut, and encourages cross-pollination of ideas. It breaks down the assumption that people should only have opinions within their own jurisdiction. The pattern is one of intentional de-siloing -- creating forums where everyone has a stake in the key issues of the day.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Start every staff meeting with a trip report or weekend report. Encourage team members to observe and share insights about areas outside their functional expertise. Create an expectation that everyone should have opinions about the business, industry, customers, and partners regardless of their specific role.</p>
