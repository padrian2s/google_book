      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 146 references an article from The Technium (Kevin Kelly's blog) titled "Was Moore's Law Inevitable?" published in July 2009. This source explores whether the exponential doubling of computing power described by Moore's Law was a natural, inevitable outcome of technological progress rather than merely an observation.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Moore's Law connects to the book's foundational argument that technology platforms are growing at exponential rates, fundamentally changing how businesses must operate. The question of whether such exponential growth is "inevitable" reinforces the urgency of adapting business strategies to technological reality rather than trying to resist or ignore it.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build your business strategy on the assumption that computing power, connectivity, and data availability will continue to grow exponentially. Rather than planning for incremental change, prepare for dramatic shifts in capability that can disrupt entire industries in short timeframes.</p>
