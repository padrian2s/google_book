      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (205) references Philip Tetlock's twenty-year study of expert predictions, published in "Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?" (Princeton University Press, 2005). Tetlock found that experts were no better than the average educated person -- and no better than random chance -- at predicting outcomes in their fields, such as whether apartheid would end nonviolently or whether Quebec would secede from Canada.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Tetlock's research is a powerful challenge to the authority of expertise in prediction. This connects to the book's argument against relying on traditional strategic planning and market research. If even domain experts cannot reliably predict highly uncertain events, organizations should focus on building adaptability and resilience rather than trying to forecast the future correctly.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Be skeptical of confident predictions about the future, even from experts. Instead of trying to predict the right path, build organizations that can quickly adapt to whichever path materializes. Invest in optionality, rapid experimentation, and the ability to pivot rather than in elaborate forecasting models.</p>
