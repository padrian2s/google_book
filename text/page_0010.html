      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This page details the founders' core operating principles: focus on the user and figure out money later, hire as many talented software engineers as possible and give them freedom. Larry and Sergey ran Google like a university lab, where intellect was the most valued asset. They were so engineering-focused that they initially blocked hiring Sheryl Sandberg because she wasn't an engineer. Management was light-touch -- informal meetings with small engineering teams and company-wide TGIF meetings replaced formal processes. The primary management tool was a ranked spreadsheet of the top 100 projects, debated in semi-quarterly meetings that blended status updates, resource allocation, and brainstorming.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "user first, revenue later" philosophy as a strategic bet. Engineering-dominated culture where even business hires needed technical credibility. The academic model applied to business -- professors don't dictate thesis projects, they provide direction. Lightweight management tools (a simple spreadsheet) replacing complex planning frameworks. The pattern of hiring leaders who are technical practitioners, not just managers.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build your organization around the people who create the core product. Use simple, transparent tools for tracking priorities rather than elaborate management systems. Hire leaders who understand the technical work, not just the business side. Create regular forums (like TGIF meetings) where any topic can be discussed openly. Maintain at least 50% of your workforce in product-creation roles.</p>
