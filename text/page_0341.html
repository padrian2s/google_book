      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 179 completes a quote from Frank Lloyd Wright's The Future of Architecture (1953), page 55. Wright observed that the greatest architecture emerged when resources were most limited, arguing that "limitations seem to have always been the best friend of architecture." This reinforces the theme that creative constraints drive better outcomes.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Wright's observation aligns with the "creativity loves constraints" principle discussed elsewhere in the book. The authors draw on examples from architecture, art, and design to show that this principle is universal -- not limited to technology or business. The greatest creative achievements often emerge not despite limitations but because of them, as constraints force innovators to think differently.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When facing resource limitations, reframe them as creative opportunities rather than obstacles. Some of the most innovative solutions in history emerged from severe constraints. Rather than waiting for ideal conditions before starting, use current limitations as a catalyst for creative thinking. The discipline of working within constraints often produces more elegant and efficient solutions than unlimited resources would.</p>
