      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 151 introduces "two-level game theory" from diplomatic circles, referencing Robert D. Putnam's 1988 paper "Diplomacy and Domestic Politics: The Logic of Two-Level Games" published in International Organization. This framework describes how negotiators must simultaneously manage expectations at two levels -- the international negotiation table and the domestic political arena.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The concept of two-level games directly applies to business leadership, where executives must simultaneously manage internal stakeholders (employees, board) and external relationships (partners, customers, regulators). The ability to navigate these parallel negotiations is a critical leadership skill that the authors identify as essential for success in complex organizations.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Recognize that most significant business decisions involve multiple stakeholder groups with different interests. Before entering any negotiation or major decision, map out who the relevant stakeholders are at each "level" and understand their priorities. Craft strategies that can achieve acceptable outcomes across all levels simultaneously.</p>
