      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Shapiro and Varian's work is one of the intellectual foundations of the strategy described in "How Google Works." Their analysis of network effects, lock-in, switching costs, and information economics directly informs the platform-first thinking that the authors advocate. Notably, Hal Varian later became Google's chief economist, bringing these ideas directly into the company's strategic decision-making.</p>
