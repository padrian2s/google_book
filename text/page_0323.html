      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 161 references Derek Sivers' TED talk "How to Start a Movement" from February 2010, which analyzes a viral video of a "dancing guy" to illustrate how movements begin. Sivers argues that the first follower is actually more important than the leader, because they transform a lone eccentric into a leader with followers.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to movement-building connects to the book's discussion of how to drive change within organizations. Innovation does not succeed through top-down mandates alone; it requires early adopters and champions who validate and amplify new ideas. The "first follower" concept is essential to understanding how grassroots innovation spreads within a company.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When launching new initiatives, focus on winning over early adopters and first followers rather than trying to convince the entire organization at once. Nurture and publicly celebrate those who support new ideas early. The visibility of the first followers can create a cascade of adoption that makes the movement unstoppable.</p>
