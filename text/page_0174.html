      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>It is hard to look at any industry without seeing a bright future. In health care, real-time personal sensors will enable sophisticated tracking of complex human systems. Combined with in-depth genetic analysis, we will have unprecedented abilities to identify and prevent health issues early. Health-care consumers currently suffer from a dearth of information -- virtually no data on procedural outcomes, doctor performance, or hospital quality. Pricing is completely opaque. Just bringing basic information transparency to health care could have a tremendous positive impact, lowering costs and improving outcomes.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Information asymmetry is the root cause of many health care problems. Making health data transparent and accessible would be transformative even before advanced AI analysis. The combination of sensors, genetic analysis, and computing power will shift health care from reactive to preventive.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Look for industries where information asymmetry creates inefficiency -- that is where technology can have the greatest impact. Invest in personal health monitoring and data aggregation. Advocate for health data transparency and interoperability.</p>
