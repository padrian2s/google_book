      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors acknowledge that they are not immune to the forces of change they describe. There are many things they don't know and are forced to relearn. They grew up using landline telephones and going to movies; the next generation of smart creatives operates with a confidence and fluency in technology that the authors can barely comprehend. They are certain that for every rock star they work with daily, there are dozens or hundreds more trying to unseat them. Somewhere, in a garage, dorm room, lab, or conference room, a brave business leader has gathered a small team of smart creatives and is using the ideas from this book to create a company that will eventually render Google irrelevant. No business wins forever, and they find that inspiring.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The closing is remarkably humble for a book by leaders of one of the world's most powerful companies. The admission that Google's eventual displacement is inevitable -- and inspiring rather than threatening -- embodies the growth mindset the entire book advocates. It also validates the book's core thesis: if these principles work, they work for everyone, including Google's future competitors. The circle is complete -- the next disruptive company will be built by the same type of smart creatives, using the same principles, just as Google was built.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Accept that no competitive advantage is permanent and find that liberating rather than threatening. Stay close to the next generation of talent to understand how they think and work differently. Remain humble about what you don't know. Apply the principles in this book not as a formula for permanent success but as a framework for creating value in the Internet Century -- knowing that the framework itself will eventually need to be reinvented.</p>
