      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (184) traces the history of employee free-time innovation programs, noting that Google was not the first to use this strategy. 3M pioneered a 15 percent time program back in 1948, which produced iconic products like Post-it notes, Scotch tape, and Scotchgard fabric protector. The note quotes 3M's long-time president William McKnight: "Hire good people, and leave them alone."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The endnote reveals that Google's famous 20 percent time policy was inspired by a much older corporate innovation tradition. The connection between 3M's 15 percent time and Google's 20 percent time shows how successful management practices get adapted and evolved across companies and decades. McKnight's philosophy of trusting talented people with autonomy is a recurring theme throughout the book.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When implementing innovation programs, study the history of similar initiatives at other companies. Structured free time for employees has a decades-long track record of producing breakthrough products. The key ingredient is not just the time allocation but the underlying trust in employees -- hiring well and then giving people space to create.</p>
