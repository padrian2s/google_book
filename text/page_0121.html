      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Building relationships requires noting the little things -- partner's and kids' names, important family issues -- which can be easily recorded in your contacts. Eric believes in the three-week rule for new positions: listen to people, understand their issues and priorities, get to know and care about them, and earn their trust. This is actually doing something important: establishing a healthy relationship. And praise is underused and underappreciated as a management tool. When it is deserved, don't hold back.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The emphasis on personal details and genuine care stands in contrast to purely transactional professional relationships. The three-week listening period demonstrates that effective leadership often requires patience rather than immediate action. The closing note on praise is significant -- in performance-driven cultures, recognition can be overlooked in favor of constant improvement, but genuine praise reinforces the behaviors and relationships that drive success.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Record personal details about colleagues in your contacts system. When starting a new role, dedicate the first three weeks to listening and relationship-building. Make praise a regular management practice -- specific, timely, and genuine recognition strengthens both relationships and performance culture.</p>
