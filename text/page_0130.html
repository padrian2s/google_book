      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In late 2009, a team of search engineers showed a prototype of Google Instant -- populating search results while the user was still typing the query. Speed was a core factor in search quality, but the clock didn't start until the user hit return. What if results appeared as the user typed? The go decision was a no-brainer. A few weeks before launch, Jonathan asked about revenue impact. No one had done a financial analysis -- the product was obviously great for the user, so launching it was the best business decision. In every other company Jonathan had worked, a financial analysis was required before launching a major product change.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Google Instant story perfectly illustrates the "focus on the user and all else will follow" principle. The full sentence is crucial -- it's not just about focusing on the user, but trusting that smart creatives will figure out how to make money from it. This requires immense confidence. Similarly, Knowledge Graph replaced ads with curated information, and the Panda algorithm update hurt Google's own revenue to improve user experience. User trust in the Internet Century is as important as any currency.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When a product change is obviously great for users, don't let financial analysis delays slow the launch. Trust that revenue will follow great user experiences, even when the short-term financial impact is negative. Distinguish between users (people who use your products) and customers (people who pay you) -- when they conflict, bias toward the user. Product excellence is the only way to be consistently successful.</p>
