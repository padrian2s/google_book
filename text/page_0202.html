      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 42 provides the solution to a logic puzzle mentioned in the main text -- the classic "two guards, one road to freedom, one road to death" riddle. The authors explain multiple valid solutions and add a humorous twist: "Or you could act like some American presidents, and order an invasion."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The puzzle demonstrates that creative solutions often involve reframing the question rather than choosing between obvious answers. Acknowledging several correct answers reflects the book's principle that good decision-making allows for multiple paths to success. The invasion joke adds levity while subtly critiquing decision-making that bypasses logic entirely.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When faced with binary choices, look for creative reframings that reveal additional options. Value logical reasoning and data-driven approaches over brute-force decision-making.</p>
