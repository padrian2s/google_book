      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The second reason product excellence is critical: experimentation and failure costs have dropped dramatically. Small teams can create products, distribute them globally for free, measure results precisely, iterate, and try again. Google[x] built the first Google Glass prototype in just ninety minutes. Even manufactured goods benefit -- digital prototyping, 3-D printing, online market testing, and crowdfunding have lowered barriers. Product development is now about rapid iteration, not standing on the shoulders of giants. Yet most management processes were designed over a century ago to lower risk and slow things down, creating architecture that works against the speed businesses now need. The traditional command-and-control structure, where data flows up and decisions flow down, is designed to slow things down.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The inversion of experimentation economics -- failure used to be expensive, now it's cheap. Speed as the new competitive advantage replacing careful planning. The mismatch between century-old management processes (designed to reduce risk) and the modern need for rapid iteration. The shift from "standing on shoulders of giants" to "standing on shoulders of lots of iterations." Traditional corporate architecture as an active impediment to the speed required for success.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Reduce the cost of experimentation in your organization by removing approval gates and shortening feedback loops. Build prototypes quickly to demonstrate ideas rather than writing lengthy proposals. Audit your management processes for unnecessary friction -- if a process was designed to prevent expensive mistakes, ask whether mistakes are still that expensive. Embrace rapid iteration as a core competency rather than treating it as recklessness.</p>
