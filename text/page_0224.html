      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 64 credits the observation that "new technologies come into the world in a primitive state" to Jonathan Rosenberg's father, Nathan Rosenberg, a distinguished economic historian. The source is Nathan Rosenberg's Perspectives on Technology (Cambridge University Press, 1976). This insight suggests that technologies should be judged by their trajectory, not their current state.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Judging new technologies by their primitive initial form rather than their potential is a common strategic error -- the authors argue for evaluating trajectory over current state. Jonathan drawing on his father's academic work demonstrates how intellectual traditions cross generations. Nathan Rosenberg's economic history provides a long-term lens for understanding technology adoption patterns.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating new technologies, assess their improvement trajectory rather than dismissing them based on current limitations. Draw on diverse intellectual traditions -- economic history, in this case -- to inform your technology and business strategy.</p>
