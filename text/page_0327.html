This ambitious project aims to extend Internet protocols to enable communication across the solar system, supporting future space exploration missions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The interplanetary Internet project exemplifies the "think 10x" philosophy the authors champion throughout the book. Rather than making incremental improvements to existing systems, Google invests in moonshot projects that push the boundaries of what seems possible. This note connects to the Conclusion section's theme of imagining the unimaginable and pursuing audacious goals.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allocate some portion of your resources to genuinely ambitious, long-term projects that could transform your field. While most work should focus on current products and near-term improvements, investing in moonshot ideas keeps your organization at the frontier of innovation and attracts the kind of ambitious talent who want to work on world-changing problems.</p>
