      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 61 provides an extensive overview of economist Michael Porter's work on competitive strategy. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, authored two landmark books: Competitive Strategy (Free Press, 1980), which introduced the five forces framework, and Competitive Advantage (Free Press, 1985), which argued that competitive advantage stems from cost leadership, differentiation, or niche focus.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Porter's frameworks provide the traditional strategic backdrop against which the book positions Google's more dynamic, technology-driven approach. By citing Porter, the authors acknowledge the foundations of strategic thinking while arguing that the Internet Century requires new approaches. Porter represents the gold standard of bringing academic rigor to practical strategy.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Understand Porter's frameworks as foundational strategic tools, but recognize that in fast-moving technology markets, the competitive landscape shifts too rapidly for purely structural analysis. Use the five forces model to understand your industry dynamics, then layer on the speed and flexibility that the Internet Century demands.</p>
