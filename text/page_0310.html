      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 148 explains the phrase "Nose In, Fingers Out" (NIFO), coined by John M. Nash, founder of the National Association of Corporate Directors. NIFO means that a board should take an active oversight role while avoiding micromanagement of the business, maintaining a balance between engagement and operational distance.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The NIFO concept embodies a critical governance principle that extends beyond boards to any leadership role: stay informed and engaged enough to provide strategic direction and oversight, but resist the urge to micromanage operational details. This reflects the book's broader theme of trusting smart creatives with autonomy while maintaining appropriate oversight.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Apply the NIFO principle at every level of leadership. Set clear strategic direction and stay informed about execution, but give your teams the space to figure out the best way to achieve goals. Boards, executives, and managers alike should resist the temptation to micromanage, instead focusing their energy on asking the right questions and removing obstacles.</p>
