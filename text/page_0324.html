      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors draw on the history of Silicon Valley's founding figures to contextualize Google's own innovation culture. Noyce's leadership style at Intel -- flat hierarchies, open communication, and empowerment of engineers -- directly influenced the management philosophy that later companies like Google adopted. This historical continuity shows that Google's culture is not accidental but part of a long tradition.</p>
