      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (188) traces the famous saying "The perfect is the enemy of the good" to Voltaire, who wrote it in one of his poems ("Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien"). However, Voltaire himself credited the saying to an Italian sage ("Il meglio e l'inimico del bene"), demonstrating the proverb's deep historical roots.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This ancient wisdom is central to Google's innovation philosophy. The tendency to over-polish products before releasing them can prevent good ideas from ever reaching users. The endnote's scholarly tracing of the quote's origin reflects the book's thorough approach to sourcing, while the proverb itself encapsulates the "ship and iterate" mentality that pervades the company.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Resist the urge to perfect products before launch. Define "good enough" quality thresholds and ship when those are met, then improve based on real user feedback. Perfectionism in product development often masks fear of failure or criticism.</p>
