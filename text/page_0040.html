      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Continuing the theme of cultural transformation, this page describes specific steps: promote transparency and sharing across divisions, open everyone's calendars, hold company-wide meetings with honest Q&A, and answer tough questions authentically. At a TGIF meeting where Motorola was discussed, Googlers asked challenging questions about the company's products. Motorolans wondered if the questioners would be fired -- revealing just how different the cultures were. When redefining culture, it can help to look at the original founder's vision. Lou Gerstner rebuilt IBM on Watson's core beliefs while scrapping obsolete trappings like the famous blue-suit dress code. Eric's answer when asked about Google's dress code: "You must wear something." The most important lesson from Motorola: practicing these principles to change culture takes far more time than expected.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Transparency as the first step in cultural transformation -- open calendars, honest Q&A, visible decision-making. The shock of cultural collision when employees from different cultures witness each other's norms (Motorolans shocked that questioners weren't fired). The principle of returning to founder values while discarding outdated practices. The dress code as a microcosm of cultural philosophy -- IBM's formal dress was about customer respect, Google's "you must wear something" is about trusting employees. The consistent warning that cultural change is slower than expected.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Start cultural change with transparency: open calendars, honest Q&A sessions, and visible information sharing. Answer tough questions honestly even when the answers are uncomfortable. Look to your founder's original values as a starting point for cultural renewal. Discard practices that have become empty rituals while preserving the values behind them. Set realistic timelines for cultural change -- double whatever you think it will take.</p>
