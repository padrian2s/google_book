      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Think about your employees -- which ones can you honestly say are smarter than you? The adage to hire people smarter than you holds true, but not for the obvious reasons. Hire them not for what they know but for what they don't yet know. Ray Kurzweil noted that information technology grows exponentially, but our intuition about the future is linear. Raw brainpower is the starting point for exponential thinking, and intelligence is the best indicator of a person's ability to handle change. However, intelligence alone isn't enough -- many bright people choose the familiar spinning-teacups ride over the roller coaster of change. The ideal candidates are "learning animals" who keep learning, have the smarts to handle massive change, and the character to love it. Carol Dweck's research on "growth mindset" supports this -- people who believe their abilities can be cultivated take more risks and learn more than those with fixed mindsets.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "learning animal" concept synthesizes several traits: intelligence, adaptability, curiosity, and resilience. The connection to Dweck's growth mindset research grounds the hiring philosophy in psychological science. The distinction between intelligence (necessary but insufficient) and learning orientation (the differentiator) is crucial -- it explains why some brilliant people stagnate while others continue to grow. The exponential vs. linear thinking framework explains why learning animals are especially valuable in technology-driven industries.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Screen for growth mindset by asking candidates about their biggest mistakes and what they learned. Look for people who have voluntarily taken on unfamiliar challenges throughout their careers. Favor intelligence and learning ability over specific domain expertise, especially in rapidly changing fields. Use Jonathan's interview question: "What big trend did you miss? What did you get right, and what did you get wrong?" -- it's impossible to fake and reveals learning animal characteristics.</p>
