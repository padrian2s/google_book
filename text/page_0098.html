      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In January 2006, Google launched Google.cn with in-country servers. Eric visited Beijing to promote the site and ended up sitting below a framed picture of Mao and Ho Chi Minh during a press interview -- the US press had a field day. But things went well: local engineers improved the product and traffic grew steadily through 2009. Then came the hacking attacks. Eric had always believed engaging in China was both good business and morally right. Sergey had always disagreed, and Larry had sided with Eric. But the attacks changed Larry's mind -- the behavior was evil and wouldn't stop. Both founders were now firmly against censoring results on Google.cn. Eric's focus shifted from making the best decision to orchestrating the best process for reaching and implementing whatever decision the company made.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Eric's shift from decision-maker to process-orchestrator is a crucial leadership insight. When you know you'll disagree with the outcome, the most important thing is to ensure the process is sound so the team can rally behind whatever is decided. Larry's position change in response to new information (the hacking attacks) demonstrates intellectual honesty -- updating beliefs when evidence changes. The contrast between Eric's pragmatic business view and the founders' values-first response shows how different leadership styles can coexist and ultimately strengthen decision-making when channeled through a good process.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When you expect to disagree with a decision outcome, focus your energy on ensuring the decision process is fair, thorough, and inclusive rather than on winning the argument. Be willing to change your position when new evidence warrants it. Recognize that values-based objections are not irrational -- they represent different weighting of long-term factors that may not show up in business analysis. Formulating strategy, hiring the right people, and creating culture are all preliminaries to the fundamental activity of all business leaders: decision-making.</p>
