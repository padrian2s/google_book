      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Most people hiring for a role look for people who have excelled in that role before -- favoring specialization over intelligence. This is exactly wrong, especially in high tech. The world is changing so fast that the role you're hiring for will change too. Yesterday's widget will be obsolete tomorrow. A specialist brings inherent bias toward solving problems using their existing expertise and may be threatened by new approaches. A smart generalist has no such bias and can survey the wide range of solutions. Finding learning animals can be done by asking candidates to reflect on past mistakes -- Jonathan asked "What big trend did you miss about the Internet in 1996?" This forces candidates to define expectations, link them to observations, and admit mistakes honestly. Few people answer well, but when they do, it indicates a genuine learning animal.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The anti-specialization argument challenges one of the most deeply held assumptions in hiring -- that relevant experience is the top predictor of success. The reasoning is compelling: in a rapidly changing environment, adaptability trumps expertise because expertise becomes obsolete. The interview question technique is elegant because it tests multiple qualities simultaneously: self-awareness, intellectual honesty, ability to connect predictions to outcomes, and comfort with admitting failure. The Einstein quote about being "passionately curious" ties the learning animal concept back to passion.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When writing job descriptions, emphasize intelligence and learning ability alongside (or above) specific experience requirements. Hire the best engineer regardless of language preference rather than an expert in your current tech stack. Develop interview questions that test for learning ability rather than existing knowledge. Create opportunities for continuous learning -- skills and experiences that aren't directly beneficial to the company -- and watch who takes advantage of them. Those who don't may not be the learning animals you thought.</p>
