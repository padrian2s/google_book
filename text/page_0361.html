      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (199) references the infamous plot twist from the 1980s TV show "Dallas," where character Bobby Ewing died tragically when his sister-in-law ran him down with a car, only to miraculously return to life the following season -- his death turned out to be "just a dream." The authors wryly note: "We should all be so lucky."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This pop culture reference likely illustrates the impossibility of undoing bad decisions in the real world. Unlike a TV show, business mistakes cannot simply be retconned away. The humorous tone is characteristic of the book's approach to making serious points through entertaining cultural references, keeping the material accessible and engaging.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Accept that business decisions have real, lasting consequences that cannot be undone with a narrative trick. This underscores the importance of thoughtful decision-making processes, even in fast-moving environments. When mistakes happen, deal with them honestly rather than wishing them away.</p>
