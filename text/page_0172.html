      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Greater collaboration among smart creatives -- scientists, doctors, engineers, designers, artists -- will result from the ability to easily compare and combine different data sets. As Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian note in Information Rules, information is costly to produce but cheap to reproduce. Google's Fusion Tables product lets related data sets be merged and analyzed together while maintaining the integrity of originals. Imagine research scientists worldwide combining their spreadsheets and databases, or local governments sharing infrastructure data. Breaking down information silos enables entirely new forms of analysis and discovery.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The economics of information -- costly to produce, cheap to reproduce -- favor open sharing on platforms. Breaking down data silos creates exponential value by enabling new combinations and analyses. Collaboration across disciplines and organizations multiplies the impact of individual data sets.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Share your data on platforms where others can build on it. Look for ways to combine data from different silos to generate new insights. Create tools and platforms that make cross-organizational data sharing easy and reliable.</p>
