      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (193) references Scott Adams's article "Scott Adams' Secret of Success: Failure" from the Wall Street Journal (October 12, 2013). Adams, the creator of Dilbert, argues for building systems rather than setting goals -- a philosophy of continuous improvement through persistent experimentation and learning from failure.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Adams's systems-over-goals philosophy resonates with Google's approach to innovation. Rather than setting rigid targets and measuring success or failure against them, building repeatable systems for experimentation, learning, and iteration produces better long-term outcomes. This connects to the book's recurring theme that failure is not the opposite of success but a necessary component of it.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Focus on building sustainable processes for innovation rather than fixating on specific outcomes. Create systems that make experimentation easy, feedback rapid, and learning automatic. A good system will produce many small failures and occasional big successes, which over time vastly outperforms a goal-oriented approach that punishes failure.</p>
