      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 158 traces the concept of evolutionary selection for ideas back to Richard Dawkins' 1976 introduction of the "meme" in The Selfish Gene. The authors connect this to Jim Collins and Jerry Porras's concept of "branching and pruning" from Built to Last -- trying many different approaches and keeping what works. They also reference Dean Keith Simonton's work on Darwinian perspectives on creativity.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors apply evolutionary biology as a metaphor for innovation management. Just as natural selection works through variation and selection, successful innovation requires generating many ideas (variation) and then rigorously testing and selecting the best ones (selection). This "branching and pruning" approach avoids the trap of betting everything on a single untested idea.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Adopt a portfolio approach to innovation: generate many ideas, run small experiments to test them, and invest more resources in the ones that show promise. Be willing to kill projects that are not working, even if significant effort has already been invested. The key is creating an environment where many experiments can run simultaneously and failures are treated as learning opportunities rather than career-ending mistakes.</p>
