      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Barksdale's collected witticisms show how memorable phrases can encode management philosophy and travel through organizations. His most famous quote -- "If we have data, let's look at data.

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Develop clear, memorable phrases that encode your leadership principles -- they spread through organizations faster than memos. Default to data in decision-making; when data is unavailable, be explicit about whose judgment takes precedence and why.</p>
