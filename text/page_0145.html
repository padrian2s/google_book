      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google Wave, which launched with fanfare in 2009, was a poster child of innovation -- a small team in Sydney exploring "What would email be like if it were invented today?" They produced a compelling prototype, got the OK to proceed, and built a platform for a new way to communicate. Wave was a technological marvel but a major flop. Usage never reached critical mass. A year after consumer launch, Google canceled Wave. But as a failure, Wave failed well: it failed quickly (no good money after bad), without stigmatizing anyone (Wave team members were highly recruited internally), and after creating valuable technology that migrated to Google+ and Gmail.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Wave illustrates what "failing well" looks like. The three criteria for a good failure: fail quickly (don't pour good money after bad), fail without stigma (don't punish the failed team), and fail after creating value (technology and learnings should be reused). The authors emphasize that management's job is not to mitigate risks or prevent failures, but to create an environment resilient enough to take on risks and tolerate the inevitable missteps. Nassim Taleb's concept of "antifragile" systems applies -- organizations that get stronger from shocks.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When a project fails, pull the plug quickly to avoid wasting resources. Don't stigmatize the failed team -- their failure is a badge of honor if they tried something bold. Morph failed ideas rather than killing them: look for components that can be reapplied elsewhere. Measure innovation health by counting both failures and successes. Create an antifragile environment where failure makes the organization stronger.</p>
