      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Creating a culture of innovation ooze isn't new -- Thomas Edison's Menlo Park lab, AT&T's Bell Labs, and Xerox's PARC were renowned incubators. The difference now is the speed and scale at which the Darwinian struggle plays out, with the Internet providing everyone tools of creation. Innovative ooze forms easily in startups with us-against-the-world mentality. But past 500 people, more risk-averse employees arrive and the ooze needs to let everyone participate. Derek Sivers' "first follower" principle applies: the ooze must encourage both the innovators and the people who want to join something innovative. Robert Noyce noted that "optimism is an essential ingredient for innovation."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "first follower" principle is critical for scaling innovation beyond a startup. Innovation needs to be integrated into the fabric of the company, across every function and region. When isolated in a special group, you may attract innovators but won't have enough first followers. The emphasis on optimism connects back to hiring: you need people who are smart enough to come up with new ideas and crazy enough to think they just might work. Then give them the place to create change and adventure.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Foster innovation culture company-wide, not in an isolated group. Encourage both the innovators (dancing fools on the hillside) and those who want to join innovative efforts. Hire optimistic people who embrace risk. Create an environment where idea evolution happens at Internet speed -- fast prototyping, quick feedback, rapid iteration.</p>
