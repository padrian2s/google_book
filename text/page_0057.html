      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Strategy chapter concludes with a distillation of the pattern behind many large, successful companies: (1) They solved a problem in a novel way, (2) They used that solution to grow and spread quickly, and (3) That success was based largely on their products. The authors emphasize that the strategy team itself matters as much as the strategy. It shouldn't just comprise the people with the longest tenure or biggest titles, but rather the best smart creatives and those who will have the best perspective on coming changes. This echoes the book's recurring theme: the quality of people determines the quality of outcomes, whether in product development, cultural design, or strategic planning.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The three-step success pattern as a universal template: novel solution, rapid growth, product-based success. The composition of the strategy team as a reflection of company values -- choosing based on insight and capability rather than tenure and title. The recursive nature of the book's advice: the same principles (hire the best people, give them freedom, focus on product) apply at every level from culture to strategy to execution.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Evaluate your venture against the three-step pattern: Do you have a novel solution? Can you scale it quickly? Is success grounded in product quality? Build your strategy team from the best thinkers regardless of seniority. Include people who understand where the industry is heading, not just where it's been. Apply the same meritocratic, smart-creative-first principles to strategic planning that you apply to everything else in the organization.</p>
