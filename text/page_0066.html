      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Beyond passion and learning ability, character is crucial in a potential hire -- someone who treats others well, can be trusted, is well-rounded, engaged with the world, and is genuinely interesting. Judging character used to be easier when interviews included meals and drinks, allowing observation of how candidates treat waiters and bartenders. Today you must be more observant during the before-and-after spaces of interviews. Jonathan tells the story of competing for a consulting job against "Hodsworth Bodsworth III" -- a more qualified but arrogant candidate. Jonathan chatted warmly with the administrative assistant while waiting; Bodsworth did not. Jonathan got the job because the interviewer's assistant reported that Bodsworth "was an asshole." The "Bodsworth rule": always ask assistants what they think of candidates.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The LAX test (would you want to be stuck at the airport with this person for six hours?) is a character and interestingness assessment disguised as a simple thought experiment. It captures multiple dimensions: intellectual engagement, social skills, curiosity, and basic human decency. The Bodsworth story illustrates that character reveals itself most clearly when people think they aren't being evaluated -- how you treat those who can't help your career is the truest measure of character. The institutionalization of "Googleyness" as a formal interview category shows how culture-fit assessment can be systematized.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Apply the LAX test to every candidate: would spending six hours stuck at an airport with this person be enjoyable and intellectually stimulating? Ask support staff and everyone who interacts with candidates for their impressions. Observe candidates in unstructured moments. Make "Googleyness" or cultural fit a formal evaluation category alongside technical skills and experience. Include ambition, drive, team orientation, service orientation, and integrity in your culture-fit assessment.</p>
