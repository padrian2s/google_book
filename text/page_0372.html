      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (210) describes smart contact lenses under development by Google[x] (now X Development), designed to track wearers' blood glucose levels by measuring glucose in tears. This technology would spare diabetics the necessity of regular, painful pinprick blood tests or wearing a glucose sensor under their skin full-time.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The smart contact lens project exemplifies Google's moonshot thinking -- using cutting-edge technology to solve real human problems at scale. It demonstrates the 70/20/10 investment philosophy, where transformative bets (the "10") can have outsized impact on people's lives. This is the kind of project that attracts the best smart creatives: ambitious, technically challenging, and genuinely meaningful.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Pursue innovation projects that combine technical ambition with genuine human impact. The most motivating moonshots are those that could meaningfully improve people's lives, not just generate revenue. Use these aspirational projects to attract and retain top talent who want their work to matter.</p>
