      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (192) quotes Nassim Nicholas Taleb's concept of "antifragility" from his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder" (2012). Taleb defines antifragility as the quality of things that benefit from shocks, volatility, randomness, and stressors. He distinguishes it from resilience or robustness: "The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The concept of antifragility aligns closely with Google's approach to innovation and failure. Rather than merely surviving disruption, the best organizations use it as fuel for improvement. This connects to the book's themes about embracing failure, iterating quickly, and building systems that learn and improve from challenges rather than simply withstanding them.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design organizational systems that improve under stress rather than merely survive it. Post-mortems after failures, rapid iteration cycles, and cultures that reward learning from mistakes are all mechanisms for building antifragility. Ask not just "how do we prevent this from happening again?" but "how did this make us stronger?"</p>
