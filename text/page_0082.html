      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>New hire compensation should start low because you can attract the best smart creatives with factors beyond money: the great things they can do, the people they'll work with, the responsibility and opportunities they'll be given, the inspiring company culture, and yes, maybe free food and happy dogs. When those smart creatives start performing, pay them appropriately -- the bigger the impact, the bigger the comp. At the opposite end, managers should reward people greatly only when they do a great job. Don't promote or pay people as if they're all equally good -- they aren't. The business world traditionally rewards being closer to the top or closer to transactions, but in the Internet Century, product excellence matters most. Big rewards should go to people closest to great products and innovations. Pay outrageously good people outrageously well, regardless of title or tenure. What counts is their impact.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The low-start, high-growth compensation model is a self-selection mechanism -- people who join for the opportunity rather than the initial paycheck are more likely to be the passionate, purpose-driven smart creatives you want. The shift from rewarding seniority and transaction proximity to rewarding product impact represents a fundamental rethinking of corporate compensation. The principle that impact determines pay regardless of title directly challenges traditional hierarchical compensation structures and aligns incentives with the company's actual value creation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design compensation packages that emphasize opportunity and impact potential for new hires. Create mechanisms to rapidly increase compensation as people prove their value. Tie rewards directly to impact rather than seniority, title, or organizational position. Ensure that the people creating the most value for customers and the company are the highest paid, even if they're not the most senior. Be willing to pay outrageously well for outrageous performance.</p>
