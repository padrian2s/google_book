      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Eric spent the 2013 holidays vacationing with his family. The kids watched videos entirely on a tablet -- the TV remained dark for the entire vacation. None of what they watched were traditional broadcast or cable shows; all were created for streaming from websites and mobile apps. This observation leads to broader questions: the disruptive impact of technology is being felt across numerous industries. The economic issues from the recession persist as technology-driven change outpaces our ability to retrain workers. Stable middle-class jobs are moving to developing nations, online, or disappearing entirely. The question is: what can businesses do to survive and thrive during periods of disruption?</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The tablet TV anecdote perfectly illustrates how quickly consumer behavior can shift when technology enables it. The children's behavior wasn't a prediction -- it was already reality. The authors acknowledge that disruption is painful and confusing, making this chapter both optimistic about technology's potential and honest about its dislocating effects. The central question shifts from "how to build a great company" to "how to survive the forces that are reshaping all companies."</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Pay attention to how the youngest generation consumes media and technology -- their behavior predicts the future. Don't dismiss rapid behavioral shifts as temporary. Prepare your business for disruption by understanding that the stable, middle-class economy of the twentieth century is being fundamentally restructured. Ask yourself what's different about today's business landscape and what will happen next.</p>
