      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The forum for decision-making is almost always a meeting, which may be the most hated of all business practices (except Secret Santa). People complain that meetings are a waste of time, but a well-run meeting is actually the most efficient way to present data, debate issues, and make decisions. Over the years, Eric's team developed rules for effective meetings: Every meeting should have a single decision-maker/owner -- include someone senior when the meeting is between groups of equals. The decision-maker should be hands-on: calling the meeting, ensuring good content, determining participants, sharing the agenda 24 hours in advance, and summarizing decisions and action items by email within 48 hours. Even non-decision meetings (brainstorms, information sharing) need a clear owner. Meetings are not like government agencies -- they should be easy to kill if their purpose isn't being served.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The meeting rules address one of the most universal complaints in business -- wasted meeting time. The single decision-maker/owner principle solves the diffusion of responsibility that makes most meetings unproductive. The 24-hour advance agenda and 48-hour follow-up email create bookend accountability. The advice that meetings should be easy to kill challenges the organizational inertia that keeps recurring meetings alive long past their usefulness. The distinction between meetings that are truly useless and meetings that are simply badly run is important -- the solution is better meeting discipline, not fewer meetings.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Assign a clear owner/decision-maker for every meeting. Share the agenda at least 24 hours in advance. Send decisions and action items to all participants within 48 hours. Keep meetings to 8 people or fewer -- if more need to know the outcome, communicate it separately. Regularly question whether recurring meetings still serve their purpose. If you attend a meeting, actually attend it -- no multitasking with laptops or phones. Begin and end on time, and schedule breaks for longer sessions. Remember: attendance is not a badge of importance.</p>
