      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 172 explains the concept of "sandbagging" in sales -- setting artificially low goals and then exceeding them dramatically. Google's first head of sales, Omid Kordestani, gained such a reputation as a sandbagger that he humorously delivered quarterly sales updates from a small stage constructed out of actual sandbags.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This anecdote connects to the book's discussion of ambitious goal-setting and OKRs. While sandbagging might seem like a safe strategy, it undermines the purpose of goal-setting, which is to drive stretch performance. Google's culture of setting ambitious targets (with the expectation of achieving about 70% of them) is the antithesis of sandbagging, and this humorous acknowledgment shows that the tension between ambitious and conservative target-setting is well understood.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create goal-setting frameworks that discourage sandbagging while not punishing failure on ambitious targets. The OKR system, which expects 60-70% achievement on stretch goals, naturally counters sandbagging by making it clear that consistently hitting 100% of targets means the targets were not ambitious enough. Use humor and self-awareness to address the natural temptation to under-promise and over-deliver.</p>
