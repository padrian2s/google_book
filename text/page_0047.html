      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In 2009, Google reviewed its product line and discovered a clear pattern: the best products achieved success based on technical factors, not business ones, while less stellar ones lacked technical distinction. Google's brand was strong enough that any new product gained initial momentum just from being a Google product, which tricked them into believing products were successful when they were actually stalling. Experiments in applying online advertising expertise to print, radio, and TV advertising were clever efforts by smart people but lacked fundamental technical insights that would shift cost-performance curves. All three failed. Looking back at other failed Google products (iGoogle, Desktop, Notebook, Sidewiki, Knol, Health, Reader), they either lacked technical insights from the outset or their original insights became dated as the Internet evolved.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Brand momentum as a dangerous source of false confidence -- initial adoption doesn't equal sustainable success. The retrospective pattern recognition of technical insight as the differentiator between successful and failed products. The trap of applying expertise to adjacent markets without a genuinely new technical insight. The lifecycle of technical insights: even good ones can become dated as technology evolves. The importance of honest post-mortems that look for structural causes of failure.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't confuse initial adoption driven by brand or distribution with genuine product-market fit. Conduct honest retrospectives on product failures looking for the presence or absence of technical insights. When expanding into adjacent markets, ensure you have a genuinely new technical insight, not just domain expertise being reapplied. Regularly reassess whether the technical insights underlying your existing products are still valid or have become dated.</p>
