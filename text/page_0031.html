      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When reorgs are necessary, do them fast. Nikesh Arora reorganized Google's thousands-strong business organization in weeks rather than months, announcing changes before all details were worked out and trusting his team to finish the job. The authors also champion Jeff Bezos's "two-pizza team" rule: teams should be small enough to feed with two pizzas. Small teams get more done, spend less time politicking, and pull together at crunch time. Finally, companies should organize around their highest-impact people -- not by function or experience, but by performance and passion. Bill Campbell quoted Debbie Biondolillo: "Your title makes you a manager. Your people make you a leader." At least 50% of people at the senior leadership table should be product experts.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Speed as the key to successful reorganizations -- announce before details are complete, trust people to fill gaps. The two-pizza rule as a practical heuristic for team size. The distinction between managers (title-based) and leaders (people-based). Organizing around high-impact individuals rather than traditional hierarchy. The principle that product people should dominate the leadership table. Warren Buffett's investment principle applied to internal teams: invest in people who will do the right thing without permission.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Execute reorganizations quickly and let teams work out the details, rather than trying to perfect the design upfront. Keep teams small enough to maintain accountability and reduce politics. Identify your highest-impact people and organize around them rather than around functions or org charts. Ensure at least half your leadership team consists of product experts. Give your best people more responsibility until they tell you it's too much.</p>
