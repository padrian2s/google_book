      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The goals of a board meeting are harmony, transparency, and advice. You want the board's support for your strategy while being completely transparent in all communications. Eric started board meetings with highlights and lowlights of the previous quarter, spending extra preparation time on lowlights because presenting bad news honestly is harder but more valuable. His lowlights covered real issues from revenue to competition, setting the stage for engaged discussion. Board presentations were constructed by product managers embedded in the business, not communications or legal teams -- giving future leaders hands-on training in executive communications.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "noses in, fingers out" philosophy for boards creates the right balance: board members should be deeply informed but not operationally involved. Leading with lowlights demonstrates radical transparency -- most organizations sugarcoat bad news for boards, but this erodes trust and reduces the board's ability to provide valuable advice. Using product managers for board presentations serves double duty: better presentations from people who know the business, and invaluable development for high-potential talent.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Lead board meetings with lowlights, not highlights. Present honest problems without pre-packaged solutions. Focus board time on strategy, products, and leadership rather than governance administrivia. Have your best operational people prepare board materials -- it develops their skills while producing more authentic presentations. Call board members periodically between meetings to maintain relationships.</p>
