      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google's colleague Vint Cerf has been working on network protocols for interplanetary communication -- the interplanetary Internet. No one can accuse Vint of not thinking big enough. But most people tend to think incrementally rather than transformationally. Google colleague Regina Dugan, former DARPA director, talks about working in "Pasteur's Quadrant" where you try to advance basic science while solving real-world problems. Eric and Larry always challenged engineers and product managers with "you aren't thinking big enough" -- later replaced by the directive to "think 10X."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Thinking big gives smart creatives much more freedom, removes constraints, and spurs creativity. Astro Teller of Google[x] notes that if you want a car with 10% better mileage, tweak the current design; but if you want 500 miles per gallon, you need to start over. The thought process itself -- "How would I start over?" -- can spur previously unconsidered ideas. Big bets also have a greater chance for success by virtue of their size, while many small bets lead to mediocrity.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Challenge yourself and your team to think 10X rather than 10%. When planning, ask "How would I start over?" to unlock breakthrough thinking. Prefer a few big bets over many small ones. Remember that bigger challenges attract bigger talent -- use audacious goals as a recruiting and retention tool.</p>
