      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors introduce their central concept: the "smart creative." Unlike traditional knowledge workers (a term coined by Peter Drucker in 1959), who build deep expertise in narrow skills and thrive in corporate process, smart creatives are fundamentally different. They are not confined to specific tasks, not limited in access to information, not averse to risk, not hemmed in by role definitions. They are encouraged to exercise their own ideas, speak up when they disagree, shift jobs frequently, and combine technical depth with business savvy and creative flair. The primary business objective must be increasing product development speed and quality, and the only way to achieve this is to attract smart creatives and create environments where they can succeed at scale.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The evolution from "knowledge worker" to "smart creative" as the key employee archetype. The shift from valuing narrow specialization to valuing multidimensional capability. Traditional management creates environments that stifle smart creatives by design -- lowering risk, restricting information, limiting autonomy. The distinction between managing for efficiency (20th century) and managing for innovation (21st century). Smart creatives as both the solution and the challenge -- they drive success but resist traditional management.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Identify the smart creatives in your organization -- they combine technical depth, business understanding, and creative energy. Remove the barriers that traditional management places on these employees: restrictive information access, rigid role definitions, risk-averse cultures. Build environments where multidimensional people can thrive rather than forcing them into narrow specializations. Recognize that managing smart creatives requires managing the environment, not the people.</p>
