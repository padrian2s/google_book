      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 171 references Rosabeth Moss Kanter's research on what creates commitment in knowledge workers. Kanter argues that knowledge workers are attracted by opportunities to take on big responsibilities and stretch their skills. The "stickiest" work settings involve opportunity and empowerment, with cutting-edge work that builds both human capital (skills and accomplishments) and financial capital. The note references her book Evolve!: Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Kanter's research provides academic support for the book's core talent strategy: attracting and retaining top talent through challenging, meaningful work rather than just compensation. The concept of building "human capital" connects to the authors' emphasis on hiring learning animals who prioritize growth opportunities. This research validates Google's approach of using opportunity and empowerment as primary retention tools.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design retention strategies around opportunity and empowerment rather than relying solely on compensation. Give knowledge workers access to cutting-edge tools, important customers, and challenging problems. Help them see how their current work builds toward even greater future responsibilities. The promise of continuous growth and increasing impact is more "sticky" than any financial incentive alone.</p>
