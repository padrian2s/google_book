      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>At Sun Microsystems, Eric experienced the dysfunction of business unit reorganization firsthand. The company reorganized into "planets" with separate P&Ls, requiring accountants to allocate revenue from the core hardware business across units. The structure document was kept secret -- read aloud to business unit leaders who weren't allowed to keep copies. The authors advocate staying functionally organized (engineering, products, finance, sales reporting to CEO) as long as possible, because business divisions create silos that stifle information and people flow. Separate P&Ls motivate leaders to prioritize their unit over the company, and leaders become focused on optimizing accounting formulas rather than creating great products.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The perverse incentives of business unit P&Ls -- leaders optimize their number rather than the company's products. The loss of productivity when organizational complexity replaces product focus. The absurdity of secret organizational documents as a signal of dysfunctional bureaucracy. Functional organization as a mechanism for preserving information flow and preventing the formation of silos. The principle that if P&Ls must exist, they should be driven by real external customers, not internal accounting formulas.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Stay functionally organized for as long as possible rather than splitting into business units. If you must have P&Ls, ensure they are driven by real external customers and revenue, not internal allocation formulas. Watch for signs that organizational complexity is distracting from product creation. Avoid secret organizational documents -- transparency is a prerequisite for good decision-making at every level.</p>
