      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (194) traces a quote usually attributed to computer scientist Jim Horning but actually originating from Nasrudin, a character from Middle Eastern folklore known as a "wise fool." The authors humorously note that they wish to be recalled centuries from now as wise fools. The story is retold in Joel ben Izzy's "The Beggar King and the Secret of Happiness."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Nasrudin -- the wise fool -- captures the spirit of intellectual humility that the authors advocate. In a culture that prizes intelligence and certainty, there is wisdom in acknowledging what you do not know and approaching problems with a beginner's mind. The misattribution of the quote also illustrates how ideas evolve and get credited to different sources over time.</p>
