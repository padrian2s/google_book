      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The web developed in three phases: Web 1.0 (browsers and basic websites), Web 2.0 (powerful web applications where users could both consume and publish), and the social web (where people talk about and share things). Before summer 2010, Google lived happily in Web 2.0 while the social web emerged, led by Facebook. Google's social efforts (Orkut, Wave, Buzz) had all failed. Vic Gundotra, who led mobile, was concerned that Google was missing a historic shift. He took Bradley Horowitz to lunch, and the two began devising a plan to reinvent Google for the social web. Social wasn't Vic's job, but he saw a problem and decided to make it happen.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Google+ origin story is a powerful example of a smart creative seeing a threat and acting even though it wasn't his responsibility. Vic and Bradley's project, code-named "Emerald Sea," became one of Google's most ambitious bets. Google+ is more accurately described as a response to the disruption of Web 2.0 by the social web rather than simply a Facebook competitor. The lesson: when one person sees that a major shift is underway with the potential to disrupt your business, and decides to do something about it, that's exactly how innovation should work in a smart-creative culture.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Watch for paradigm shifts in your industry, even when current business is thriving. Empower people to act on threats they perceive, regardless of their formal role. Don't wait for disruption to hit -- when someone sees a problem, encourage them to build a solution. Recognize that the most important innovations may be defensive responses to existential threats, not just new product ideas.</p>
