      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 153 provides background on Calafia, the restaurant where Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt chose to meet. It is owned by chef Charlie Ayers, Google's first chef (the campus cafe is named after him). However, the authors note the practical reason for the meeting location was its proximity to Steve Jobs' home, not the Google connection.</p>
