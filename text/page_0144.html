      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>After launching, some products get better and gather momentum while others wither. Leadership's job is to feed the winners and starve the losers, regardless of prior investment. Use data to decide which is which. The sunk-cost fallacy -- continuing to invest because you've already invested millions -- must be fought with data. At Excite@Home, when a section's traffic dropped, management moved it to a better spot on the page rather than letting it die. Google Chrome launched in 2008 with minimal marketing and gained momentum on its own. Only after it proved itself as a winner with seventy million users did Google approve a marketing push. Don't launch crummy products expecting the brand to carry them.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Chrome story illustrates the ideal ship-and-iterate pattern: launch quietly, let the product prove itself through excellence, then invest in marketing winners. The Excite counterexample shows the common failure mode -- feeding losers by giving them better page real estate instead of letting them die. Eric's rule: "There should be a plan for a 'wow' feature reasonably soon after launch" ensures products launch with quality while expanding rapidly. The soft opening restaurant metaphor captures the right approach -- push babies out of the nest without a jetpack.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Launch products quietly (soft opening) and let them prove themselves before investing in marketing. Actively starve underperforming products rather than propping them up. Use data to quickly identify winners and losers. Fight the sunk-cost fallacy by making resource allocation decisions based on future potential, not past investment. Plan a "wow" feature for shortly after launch to maintain momentum.</p>
