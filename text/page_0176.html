      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Whether in crime, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, defense, energy, aerospace, or education, every pursuit will be transformed by technology. Each transformation will be driven by a small team of determined, empowered smart creatives. The authors acknowledge they are not immune to change -- there are many things they do not know, and the next generation of smart creatives sees the world differently. They are certain that for every rock star they meet in their daily work, there are dozens more working to unseat them. Somewhere in a garage or dorm room, a brave leader has gathered a team of smart creatives and may be creating a company that will render Google irrelevant.</p>
