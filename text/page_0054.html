      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Netflix's recommendation algorithm had plateaued internally, so they published 100 million anonymized movie ratings and offered a $1 million prize to anyone who could beat their algorithm by 10%. They even reported progress on a public leaderboard. Within three years, a winning solution emerged. Open source has another benefit: it shows there are no hidden agendas, signaling that the playing field is level. User freedom -- the opposite of customer lock-in -- is also important: Google has a team dedicated to making it easy for users to leave. However, open is not a moral argument; it's a strategic tactic. There are exceptions: Google keeps its search and ads algorithms closed because opening them would compromise quality. When they bought Android in 2005, Sergey suggested making it open to scale quickly in the fragmented mobile OS space, while Apple kept iOS closed. Both strategies succeeded because both were based on strong technical insights.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Netflix Prize as a model for using openness to solve internal innovation plateaus. Open source as a trust signal -- showing there are no hidden advantages. User freedom (easy exit) as a competitive discipline, not a liability. The pragmatic exceptions to open: when you have an obviously superior product based on strong technical insights in a rapidly growing market, closed can work. The Android vs. iOS comparison: both strategies can succeed under the right conditions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When internal innovation plateaus, consider opening up data or challenges to external contributors. Use open-sourcing to build trust and demonstrate no hidden advantages. Build a team dedicated to making it easy for customers to leave -- this creates accountability. Keep closed only when opening up would genuinely harm quality (not just your competitive position). If you choose a closed strategy, ensure it's backed by genuinely superior technical insights, not just a desire for control.</p>
