      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One of the frustrations of leading smart creatives is how little power you actually have. You can't pound your fist and dictate decisions -- you'll lose your best people. Instead you must analyze data, orchestrate consensus, encourage debate, and know exactly when to cut off discussion and decide. There is one thing leaders can control: the company's calendar. When facing a critical decision, use your convening power to hold regular meetings -- daily if the decision is important enough. Daily meetings signal importance and reduce rehashing since memories stay fresh. Eric used this in 2002 negotiating the AOL search and ads deal. He was concerned about the financial commitment and disagreed with Larry and Sergey who wanted to take the risk. He set up daily 4 PM meetings for six weeks. Initially progress was slow, but the daily debate forced deeper analysis of the ads engine data, eventually demonstrating the deal wasn't as risky as thought. They did the deal, and performance exceeded all guarantees.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The AOL negotiation story illustrates how daily meetings can overcome analysis paralysis and build genuine consensus through repeated engagement with data. The process worked precisely because Eric disagreed with the outcome initially -- his skepticism drove deeper analysis, which ultimately revealed that the founders' instinct was right. The calendar as the leader's power tool is a practical insight: you may not be able to dictate decisions, but you can dictate when and how often people come together to make them. Daily cadence prevents the decay of urgency and memory that derails weekly or monthly decision processes.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>For critical decisions, schedule daily meetings until a decision is reached. Use meeting frequency to signal the importance of a decision to the organization. Don't shy away from repeating the same debate daily -- the repetition forces deeper engagement with the data and often reveals insights that surface meetings miss. When you disagree with the likely outcome, let the process prove you wrong (or right) rather than blocking the decision. Use daily meetings for any negotiation or decision that is fundamental to the company's existence.</p>
