      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 183 shares a Steve Jobs quote: "If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions, and you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay." This was quoted in a CNN Digital Biz blog post by Mark Milian from August 2011 titled "Why Apple Is More Than Just Steve Jobs."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Jobs' quote perfectly encapsulates a central thesis of the book: that the best talent demands autonomy and a meritocracy of ideas. Even at Apple -- a company often associated with top-down leadership -- the principle that "the best ideas have to win" was fundamental. This convergence between Google's and Apple's philosophies on this point reinforces the universality of idea-driven management in the technology industry.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build an organization where the best ideas win regardless of who proposes them. This requires creating an environment of psychological safety where anyone can challenge established thinking, combined with decision-making processes that evaluate ideas on their merits rather than on the seniority or political influence of their proponents. When great people see that the best ideas consistently win, they stay; when they see politics and hierarchy trumping merit, they leave.</p>
