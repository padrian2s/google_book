      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The copyright page reveals that the book is copyrighted by Google, Inc. rather than by the individual authors, suggesting the book was produced as a corporate endeavor with institutional support. The September 2014 publication date places it at a pivotal moment in tech history -- before the widespread adoption of AI, ride-sharing, and many other technologies that have since reshaped the landscape the book describes.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When reading business and technology books, always note the publication date and consider how the landscape has evolved since then. The core principles in "How Google Works" -- about culture, talent, and innovation -- remain relevant, but specific examples and predictions should be evaluated against the decade of change that has occurred since 2014.</p>
