      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>While Google believes in paying extraordinary people extraordinarily well for extraordinary success, they don't pay people for successful 20% projects. The reward comes from the work itself. Studies have shown that extrinsic rewards don't encourage creativity and can actually hinder it by turning an inherently rewarding endeavor into a money-earning chore. The best example of intrinsic rewards came in August 2005 when Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast. Google Earth had been in the market for only eight weeks, but the small, overworked "geo" team sprang into action, launching over eight thousand satellite images to help rescue workers navigate devastated neighborhoods.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Hurricane Katrina response exemplifies intrinsic motivation at its finest. No one told the team to camp out at the office for several nights, reach out to the Google Earth community for volunteers, or work with NOAA for satellite images. The only executive involvement was Eric visiting their war room and saying "keep doing what you're doing." This 20% project has since become the full-time Crisis Response team at Google.org. The pattern is clear: when people are genuinely motivated by the work itself, they achieve things no amount of monetary incentive could produce.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't tie monetary rewards to innovation projects -- let the work be its own reward. Create opportunities for people to contribute to meaningful causes through their skills. When teams self-organize around a crisis or opportunity, get out of their way. Provide intrinsic motivation through meaningful work, autonomy, and the satisfaction of solving important problems.</p>
