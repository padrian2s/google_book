      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 56 provides an extended discussion of Peter Drucker's 1974 insights on long-range planning from Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices (Harper and Row, 1974). Drucker argued that "short range" and "long range" are not determined by time span but by the span over which a decision is effective. He compared meaningless long-range resolutions to "the eight-year-old boy's plan to be a fireman when he grows up."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Drucker's insight reframes planning around impact duration rather than calendar time -- a critical distinction for technology companies where change is rapid. His 1974 observation remains relevant decades later, demonstrating that foundational management principles endure. The critique of meaningless long-range resolutions targets common corporate planning theater.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Evaluate decisions by their impact horizon, not their execution timeline -- a quick decision with decade-long consequences requires more deliberation than a long project with short-term effects. Avoid "planning theater" where the act of planning substitutes for genuine strategic thinking. Distinguish between real decisions with consequences and aspirational statements that carry no binding force.</p>
