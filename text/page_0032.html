      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors continue the theme of organizing around high-impact people. Warren Buffett looks for companies run by leaders who don't need him -- people committed to success for its own sake, not to cash out. The same principle applies to internal teams. But this doesn't mean creating a star system; the best systems are built around ensembles, like a dance troupe rather than coordinated superstars. At the product level, you shouldn't be able to reverse-engineer a company's org chart from its product design. When Eric was at Sun, he found six competing "Read me first" documents in a server box, each from a different division's hippo. Apple's iPhone, by contrast, puts the customer first -- you can't tell which internal team "won" when you open the box. Government websites and TV remotes are examples of org-chart-driven design at its worst.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The ensemble model over the star system -- building deep benches of talent rather than depending on individuals. The product design test: if users can see your org chart in your product, that's a failure. The problem of internal politics manifesting in customer-facing products ("Read me first" competition). The principle that the customer's experience should drive organizational decisions, not the reverse.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Test your products by asking: can a customer reverse-engineer our org chart from this? If so, redesign. Build ensemble teams with deep benches rather than depending on individual stars. When internal teams compete for customer attention within a single product, the customer loses -- intervene to create a unified experience. Give your best people more responsibility, trusting them to manage their own limits.</p>
