      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google's emphasis on quality hiring does not mean the process has to be slow. In fact, everything about their method is designed for speed: half-hour interviews, maximum five per candidate, immediate thumbs-up or thumbs-down feedback to recruiters, and hiring packets designed for 120-second committee review. These steps make the process scalable and force clarity. They're also good for candidates, since piling on interviews and stringing out decisions is unfair -- the best people want to move fast too. But there is a golden rule that cannot be violated: The urgency of the role isn't sufficiently important to compromise quality in hiring. In the inevitable showdown between speed and quality, quality must prevail.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "golden rule" of hiring quality over speed resolves the tension between the need for fast hiring and the imperative of quality. The system design is elegant: every component is optimized for speed (short interviews, immediate feedback, quick packet review), but the output standard (quality) is never compromised. This means the bottleneck is always candidate quality, not process speed. The candidate-centric perspective (the best people have options and want to move fast) aligns company interests with candidate experience -- a rare win-win in hiring.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Optimize every step of the hiring process for speed while never compromising the quality bar. Set specific time targets for each step: 30-minute interviews, 24-hour feedback, 120-second packet review. When a manager pressures you to fill a role quickly with a less-than-ideal candidate, hold firm. It's better to leave a role open than to fill it with the wrong person. Build a pipeline of quality candidates so that urgency doesn't force compromise. Remember: a bad hire is far more expensive than a delayed hire.</p>
