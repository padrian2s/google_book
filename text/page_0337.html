      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 175 attributes the phrase "creativity loves constraints" to Marissa Mayer and notes that the counterintuitive idea that constraints can foster creativity has been supported by research. The note references a 2001 American Psychologist study by Patricia D. Stokes that used Claude Monet's artistic evolution as a case study for how constraints drive creative variation.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The idea that constraints fuel rather than hinder creativity is a recurring theme in innovation literature and one the authors embrace. Rather than providing unlimited resources and freedom, smart constraints focus creative energy and force novel solutions. This principle connects to the book's advocacy for disciplined innovation -- structure and constraints channel the energy of smart creatives productively.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use constraints strategically to drive creativity. Tight deadlines, limited budgets, and specific technical requirements can all force teams to find innovative solutions they would never discover with unlimited resources. When framing projects, define clear constraints alongside ambitious goals to channel creative energy in productive directions.</p>
