      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One search team circumvents the challenge of finding collaborators through "demo days" -- a week spent building prototypes of new ideas, presented at a science-fair-style open house on Friday. Before the week starts, engineers clear calendars of all meetings. They must recruit at least one other person to their team. Results at the end are prototypes, most of which won't progress further. Steve Jobs did something similar at NeXT, with engineering teams periodically stopping regular work to build applications for their platform. The most valuable result of 20% time isn't the products created, but the skills people develop by trying something new and collaborating with unfamiliar colleagues. As Urs Holzle points out, 20% time may be the best educational program a company can have.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Demo days solve the "finding collaborators" problem in non-hierarchical organizations by creating a forcing function for collaboration. The requirement to recruit at least one other person prevents solo endeavors and builds cross-team relationships. The learning benefit of 20% time is arguably more important than the product output -- people develop skills outside their day-to-day work and build relationships with colleagues they don't normally interact with. Even projects that don't produce breakthrough products yield smarter, more versatile employees.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Implement demo days or hackathons where teams build prototypes in a constrained timeframe. Require cross-team collaboration -- no solo projects. Present results publicly to celebrate learning, not just outcomes. View innovation time primarily as an investment in employee development and cross-pollination, with product breakthroughs as a bonus.</p>
