      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>After all the work creating a great hiring process, how do smart creatives repay you? By leaving. This isn't a bad thing -- it's an inevitable by-product of a healthy, innovative team. Still, fight like hell to keep them. The best retention strategy is to keep smart creatives from getting too comfortable by always making their jobs interesting. When Georges Harik, who created AdSense and helped solve the "ads suck" problem, was thinking of leaving, Eric invited him to sit in on staff meetings. Georges got perspective from the engineering trenches while Eric and the leadership team learned about business from him. He stayed two more years. Jonathan rotated APMs through six-month stints as his chief of staff, and other APMs signed up for "chain-gang tasks" like side projects posted on an internal site. One task was helping Larry Page learn how projects got done at Google.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "Trade the M&Ms, keep the raisins" metaphor captures a counterintuitive management challenge: when pushing rotation, managers instinctively hold onto their best people (M&Ms) and let go of mediocre ones (raisins). The right approach is the opposite -- trade your best people to keep them challenged. The retention-through-challenge strategy works because smart creatives are motivated by growth and intellectual stimulation more than comfort and stability. The APM rotation and chain-gang tasks institutionalized this principle, creating constant novelty and challenge opportunities.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Keep your best people engaged by regularly offering new challenges, exposure to different parts of the business, and opportunities for growth. When a top performer seems restless, don't wait for the departure -- proactively find new experiences (staff meeting access, rotation opportunities, special projects). Create formal rotation programs or side project opportunities. When discussing rotations in staff meetings, ask: Who on your team is a good candidate? Where do they want to go? Is that the best thing for them? And be willing to trade your M&Ms rather than hoard them.</p>
