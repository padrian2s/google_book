      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Bobblehead dolls aren't just at baseball games -- they're in conference rooms, sitting around tables nodding in rhythmic unison. Tim Armstrong called this the "bobblehead yes" (Eric had his own name at Novell: the "Novell nod"). Bobblehead yessers differ from classic yes-men because they don't just agree -- they complain, whine, and fail to support the very thing they nodded to as soon as they leave. Getting everyone to say yes doesn't mean agreement. Many leaders strive for "consensus-driven" decisions but misunderstand consensus. From Latin: cum (together with) + sentire (to think or feel) means "to think or feel together" -- not unanimity but coming to the best idea and rallying around it. Reaching the best idea requires conflict. You won't get buy-in until all choices are debated openly. To achieve true consensus, you need dissent. If you're in charge, don't state your position at the outset -- make sure everyone's voice is heard first.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The etymology of consensus (thinking together, not agreeing unanimously) reframes the concept from conflict-avoidance to constructive conflict. The bobblehead phenomenon is a specific pathology of false consensus that plagues organizations -- apparent agreement masking real disagreement that surfaces later as passive resistance. General Patton's observation that "if everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking" connects military leadership wisdom to corporate decision-making. The advice to withhold the leader's position initially prevents anchoring bias and creates space for genuine dissent.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't mistake nodding heads for genuine agreement. Create an environment where dissent is not just tolerated but expected and encouraged. As a leader, share your position last, not first. Call on quiet people specifically -- they may be dissenters who are afraid to speak up or shy but brilliant contributors. Use "stupid softballs" to lower the barrier to disagreeing with the boss. Surface all potential dissent early in the process since late dissent creates more resistance than early dissent. Use data to depersonalize disagreements and make it safer to challenge ideas.</p>
