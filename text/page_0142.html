      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The suggestion box was revolutionary when introduced by Scottish shipbuilder William Denny in 1880, and at John Patterson's National Cash Register Company in 1904, employees submitted over seven thousand ideas with a hit rate of one-third. A century later, Marissa Mayer ran meetings at Google like "The Gong Show" where people demoed ideas until they were gonged. Craig Nevill-Manning evolved this into "Beer and Demos" meetings. The biggest danger is not the conceit that only managers have good ideas, but that only the company's employees have them. Good ideas come from anywhere -- including outside the company.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The evolution from suggestion boxes to demo meetings to crowdsourced innovation shows how the basic principle -- good ideas come from everywhere -- has been amplified by technology. Google let users translate web pages into local languages, let citizen cartographers map roads via Map Maker, and tapped external developers worldwide. When Larry was asked how many engineers Google needed, he said "a million" -- meaning the total ecosystem of external developers building on Google platforms. This outsider innovation creates a leverage multiplier far beyond what any internal team could achieve.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create forums for anyone to present ideas, with formats that are fun and accessible. Look beyond your employees for innovation -- users, developers, and community members often have the best ideas. Build tools and platforms that let outsiders contribute. When you find good maps simply don't exist, let users create them rather than hiring specialists.</p>
