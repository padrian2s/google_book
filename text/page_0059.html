      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The chapter title itself makes a bold claim -- that hiring is not just important but THE most important thing you do. This sets up the argument that no amount of strategy, culture-building, or product development can compensate for getting the people wrong. It signals a shift from the organizational and strategic topics of previous chapters to the deeply personal and human dimension of building a company.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Before diving into the chapter's specific hiring advice, reflect on how much time you personally spend on hiring-related activities. If hiring is truly the most important thing, your calendar should reflect that priority. Consider tracking how many hours per week you dedicate to sourcing, interviewing, and evaluating candidates.</p>
