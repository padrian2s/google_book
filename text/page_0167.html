      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This page lists Eric Schmidt's other book, "The New Digital Age: Reshaping The Future of People, Nations and Business" (coauthored with Jared Cohen), followed by the beginning of a Glossary defining key terms used throughout the book. Key terms include: AdSense (ads on publisher sites), AdWords (Google's flagship ads product), Android (open-source mobile OS), APM (Associate Product Manager), cloud computing, Coase's law (explaining why firms exist based on transaction costs), Dory (internal Q&A system), and Google[x] (the team working on ambitious projects like self-driving cars and Project Loon).</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The glossary serves as a reference for the specialized vocabulary the book introduces. Many terms like "smart creative," "HiPPO," and "obligation to dissent" are cultural concepts unique to Google that the authors argue should be adopted more broadly. The inclusion of Coase's law is particularly significant as it provides the theoretical foundation for why companies are structured differently in the Internet Century.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use the glossary as a quick reference for Google's organizational vocabulary. Consider which concepts (like OKRs, smart creatives, obligation to dissent) could be adapted and adopted in your own organization. Develop your own shared vocabulary for important cultural concepts.</p>
