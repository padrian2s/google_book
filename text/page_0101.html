      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The decision reached that Sunday evening wasn't to pull out immediately. Rather, Google would disclose the hacking attack with maximum transparency, announce plans to stop censoring results on Google.cn, and give themselves time to discuss with Chinese officials. On Monday Eric discussed it with the board, and on Tuesday January 12, 2010, they went public. Chinese government officials called the Beijing office wondering if it was a joke -- "No one does this," they were told. Google tried to find a solution consistent with both their public position and Chinese law, but it failed. In March they shut down Google.cn, redirecting users to Google.com.hk in Hong Kong. Traffic dropped precipitously. At the January 15 TGIF meeting, Googlers gave the senior team a thunderous standing ovation. Employees in China feared for their jobs and security, but the team led by Alan Eustace kept morale on track. The legacy was goodwill from Googlers worldwide and reaffirmation of principles governing tough decisions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The China aftermath demonstrates several key decision-making principles: transparency (being the only company to publicly disclose the attacks), graduated response (announcing intent rather than immediately pulling out), willingness to accept consequences (traffic loss, market exit), and caring for affected employees. The standing ovation at TGIF shows how principled decisions, even costly ones, strengthen organizational culture and employee commitment. The nuanced handling of the transition (redirecting to Hong Kong rather than simply shutting down) showed continued concern for Chinese users.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When making difficult public decisions, prioritize transparency over self-protection. Build in transition time rather than making abrupt changes. Care visibly for people affected by the decision, especially those in vulnerable positions. Use the aftermath of tough decisions to reinforce organizational values and principles. Recognize that the long-term cultural benefit of principled decisions often outweighs the short-term business cost.</p>
