      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 159 references Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species (page 17 of the Digireads.com 2007 edition). Darwin's foundational work on natural selection and evolution is cited to reinforce the idea that the strongest organizations, like the strongest species, are those that adapt most effectively to changing environments.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The direct reference to Darwin further develops the evolutionary metaphor for innovation. The authors ground their management philosophy in one of the most fundamental scientific frameworks -- natural selection -- suggesting that the principles governing biological evolution also apply to the evolution of ideas, products, and organizations in competitive markets.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build organizational adaptability as a core competency. Just as species that cannot adapt to changing environments face extinction, companies that fail to evolve their products, strategies, and cultures in response to market changes will be displaced by more adaptable competitors. Prioritize speed of adaptation over perfection of planning.</p>
