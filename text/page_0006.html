      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Larry Page's foreword describes how Google was built on the principle of autonomy of thought -- starting from first principles rather than accepting prevailing wisdom. He recounts how Google itself began from a literal dream about downloading the web and keeping the links, which evolved into a search engine. He highlights that Gmail, Android, and other major products also started as ambitious, seemingly impossible ideas. Page emphasizes that most people haven't been educated in "moonshot thinking" and tend to assume things are impossible, which is why Google invests heavily in hiring independent thinkers and setting big goals.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>First-principles thinking as a competitive advantage. The tension between incrementalism and revolutionary change -- Page argues that companies comfortable with incremental improvements become irrelevant over time because technology-driven change is revolutionary, not evolutionary. The importance of hiring independent thinkers who can resist conventional wisdom. The pattern of "wildly speculative" investments (self-driving cars, balloon-powered Internet) becoming mainstream over time.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating ideas, start from what is physically possible rather than what seems conventionally feasible. Hire people who think independently rather than those who simply follow established approaches. Make big bets on the future even when they seem speculative -- today's moonshots become tomorrow's mainstream products. Fight the organizational tendency toward incrementalism by deliberately setting ambitious goals.</p>
