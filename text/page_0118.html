      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Building platforms and product ecosystems requires working with partners in situations of "coopetition" where companies compete in some areas while collaborating in others. The key to success is diplomacy. Complex business partnerships are similar to realpolitik diplomacy between countries: relations should be managed based on pragmatic principles, not ideology. As Kissinger demonstrated with his 1969 approach to China, partners should be judged by actions rather than ideology. For the most important partnerships, companies should create dedicated roles focused on serving dual constituencies.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The diplomacy metaphor reframes competitive partnerships from zero-sum conflicts to ongoing relationships requiring pragmatic management. The dual-constituency role is distinct from traditional sales, which is weighted toward the company's interests -- a true partnership role must genuinely serve both sides to be sustainable. Acknowledging differences and accepting they are permanent is the essential first step.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Accept that your partners have their own belief systems and interests. Create dedicated partnership roles focused on keeping both sides happy, not just extracting value. Manage partner relationships based on pragmatic mutual benefit, not ideological alignment. Maintain partnerships even through disagreements.</p>
