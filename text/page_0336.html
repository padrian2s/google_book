      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 174 clarifies that the authors substituted placeholder values (WW, XX, YY, and ZZ) for the actual numbers in an OKR that was shared internally at Google. This was done to protect confidential business metrics while still illustrating how OKRs are structured and used in practice.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note demonstrates the balance between transparency (sharing how Google actually uses OKRs) and confidentiality (protecting specific business metrics). The authors practice what they preach regarding openness while respecting appropriate boundaries, showing that radical transparency has practical limits, especially when discussing publicly traded company information.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When sharing management practices and processes externally, find ways to illustrate the approach without revealing confidential data. Placeholder values and anonymized examples allow you to share valuable knowledge about your processes while protecting sensitive information. This approach enables learning and knowledge-sharing across organizations without compromising competitive advantage.</p>
