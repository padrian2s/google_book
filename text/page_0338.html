      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Henry Ford connects the book's modern tech-industry advice to a longer tradition of industrial innovation. Ford's approach -- making products accessible to the masses through efficiency and scale -- parallels Google's strategy of providing services freely to billions of users. Both models prioritize scale and accessibility as drivers of value creation.</p>
