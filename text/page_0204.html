      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 44 describes the aggressive behavior of elephant seals, citing a scientific study: weaners caught trying to steal milk were "usually chased out of the harem" after being bitten by neighboring females. The source is Reiter, Stinson, and Le Boeuf's "Northern Elephant Seal Development: The Transition from Weaning to Nutritional Independence" (Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, Volume 3, August 1978). This colorful reference supports a point about organizational dynamics and norm enforcement.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors use animal behavior research to illuminate organizational dynamics, making abstract concepts vivid and memorable. Citing behavioral ecology in a business book demonstrates the intellectual breadth the authors value and practice. The seal colony's collective response to rule-breakers parallels how healthy organizational cultures self-police norms.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Recognize that strong cultures enforce their own norms -- when values are truly shared, the group itself addresses violations. Draw insights from unexpected sources; cross-disciplinary thinking often yields the freshest perspectives on familiar problems.</p>
