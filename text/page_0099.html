      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Different institutions take different approaches to decision-making based on their structure. The Marines (top-down) keep it simple: one person gives orders and everyone acts. Big corporations (bureaucratic) require extensive analysis before deciding, often resulting in endless delays. Hip start-ups (consensus) have the CEO proclaim she works for the employees and decisions are made collectively -- collegial and considerate, but arguments last forever. So who's right? All and none. The pace of business change requires fast decisions (Marines win). Being well-informed requires thorough analysis (corporations have an edge). Having smart creatives requires giving everyone a say (start-ups). The answer is that when making decisions, you can't just focus on the right outcome. The process, timing, and implementation are just as important. A poorly executed decision-making process reverberates far beyond that one issue.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The three decision-making archetypes (Marines/top-down, corporate/bureaucratic, start-up/consensus) create a useful framework for understanding organizational approaches. The insight that all three are partially right and partially wrong suggests that the ideal approach synthesizes elements of each: speed from the military model, thoroughness from the corporate model, and inclusiveness from the start-up model. The emphasis on process over outcome is counterintuitive but profound -- a good process can survive a wrong decision, but a bad process undermines even correct decisions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design your decision-making process to combine speed, thoroughness, and inclusiveness. Don't default to just one model -- adapt based on the decision's importance and urgency. Remember that the decision-making process itself sends signals to the organization about values and culture. Invest in getting the process right because you'll make many decisions over time, and a trusted process creates organizational resilience even when individual decisions turn out wrong.</p>
