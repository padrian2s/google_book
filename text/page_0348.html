      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (186) references Alan G. Robinson and Sam Stern's "Corporate Creativity: How Innovation and Improvement Actually Happen," specifically pages 66-70. The book examines how real innovation occurs in organizations, often through unexpected channels rather than formal R&D processes.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reference to Robinson and Stern's work emphasizes a key theme: innovation does not follow neat, predictable paths. Corporate creativity often emerges from informal interactions, unexpected connections, and bottom-up initiatives rather than top-down mandates. This aligns with Google's belief in creating environments where serendipity can flourish.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Study how innovation actually happens in your organization versus how you think it happens. Often the most impactful improvements come from unexpected sources. Design your workplace and processes to maximize the chances of serendipitous discovery and cross-pollination of ideas.</p>
