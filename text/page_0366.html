      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (204) traces the quote about urgency concentrating the mind to Samuel Johnson, as recorded in James Boswell's biography: "Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." The reference is to Boswell's "Life of Johnson," a landmark work of English biography.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Johnson's observation about the focusing power of urgency connects to the book's themes about deadline-driven innovation and the importance of maintaining a sense of urgency even in successful organizations. Complacency is the enemy of innovation, and sometimes the perception of existential threat is what drives the most creative problem-solving.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Use deadlines and a sense of urgency strategically to focus teams on what matters most. While artificial urgency can be counterproductive, genuine constraints and meaningful deadlines help cut through indecision and prioritize action. The key is ensuring the urgency is real and connected to meaningful outcomes.</p>
