      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 47 provides a nuanced discussion of burnout research. While work overload is an obvious cause, research shows lack of control is equally culpable, along with insufficient reward, breakdown in community, absence of fairness, and conflicting values. Psychologist Christina Maslach, the leading burnout researcher, frames burnout as a mismatch between people and their jobs, placing the burden on organizations to create more humane work environments. The source is Maslach and Leiter's The Truth About Burnout (Jossey-Bass, 1997).</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Maslach's research shifts burnout from an individual failure to an organizational design problem -- directly supporting the book's thesis that management must create environments where smart creatives can thrive. Lack of control as a burnout driver reinforces the book's emphasis on giving smart creatives freedom and ownership. Burnout stems from six factors (overload, lack of control, insufficient reward, community breakdown, unfairness, conflicting values), not just overwork.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Address burnout systemically by examining all six factors -- simply reducing hours is insufficient if the root cause is lack of autonomy or unfairness. Give employees meaningful control over their work; autonomy is one of the strongest protections against burnout. Build community and fairness into your organizational design; these cultural factors are as important as workload management.</p>
