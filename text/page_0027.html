      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Teams should be functionally integrated -- product managers, engineers, and designers sitting together, not segregated by function. The authors contrast the traditional product manager (focused on PERT charts, Gantt charts, and the "Official Plan") with the Internet Century product manager who works alongside engineers to find technical insights that make products better. At Excite@Home, management kept customer support in crowded original offices rather than moving them to a new empty building, using the new space for lunchtime soccer instead -- because games brought people together while uncrowded space would pull them apart. Messiness is also endorsed: Larry Page protested when facilities cleaned up the office, saying "Where did all my stuff go?" Messiness is a by-product of self-expression and innovation, and squashing it has a powerful negative effect.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Functional integration over functional segregation -- product managers need to sit with engineers, not in separate buildings. The redefinition of the product manager role from plan executor to technical insight finder. The counterintuitive choice to keep people crowded rather than spreading them out when space is available. Messiness as a positive signal of creative energy rather than a problem to solve. The principle of investing in what matters (computing power, tools) while ignoring what doesn't (tidy desks, fancy furniture).</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Seat cross-functional teams together rather than organizing by department. Redefine your product managers' role from plan administration to finding technical insights. Don't over-invest in office tidiness -- let employees express themselves in their workspace. Be generous with work resources (computing power, software tools) while being frugal with status amenities. Expect people to work in the office, not from home, and load the office with amenities that make that attractive.</p>
