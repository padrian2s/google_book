      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (208) describes the UK's 1865 Locomotive Act (one of the "Red Flag Acts"), which required cars to be preceded by a pedestrian waving a red flag to warn horses and riders. The law set speed limits at two miles per hour in towns and four in the country, and was not repealed until 1896. It references historical accounts from Alasdair Nairn and Brian Ladd.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Red Flag Act is a classic example of regulation designed to protect an existing technology (horse-drawn transport) at the expense of a transformative new one (automobiles). This historical parallel is powerful because it shows how obviously misguided such protectionism looks in hindsight, even though it seemed reasonable at the time. The authors use this to argue against similar regulatory impulses in the digital age.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating regulations that restrict new technologies, ask whether they resemble "red flag laws" -- well-intentioned rules that ultimately serve to protect incumbents and slow progress. Advocate for regulatory frameworks that balance legitimate safety concerns with the freedom to innovate.</p>
