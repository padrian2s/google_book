      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The remaining email rules: (7) Don't yell electronically. (8) Make follow-up easy by copying yourself and labeling notes "follow up." (9) Help your future self search by forwarding items with descriptive keywords. The chapter then introduces the "Have a Playbook" section with Bill Campbell's approach to 1:1s: both manager and employee write their top five items independently, then compare lists. Bill's four-category 1:1 format covers performance, peer relationships, management/leadership, and innovation practices.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The self-search tip presciently anticipated how personal information management would become search-based rather than folder-based. The "match the lists" 1:1 technique surfaces misalignment without confrontation. If a manager and direct report cannot independently identify the same top problems, the relationship needs attention. The four-category framework ensures 1:1s cover both tactical performance and strategic growth.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Forward important documents to yourself with searchable keywords. Before each 1:1, write your top five discussion items independently. Compare lists at the start of the meeting. Structure conversations around performance, cross-team relationships, leadership development, and innovation.</p>
