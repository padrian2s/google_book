      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One Friday in May 2002, Larry Page found that some Google ads were completely unrelated to search queries -- "Kawasaki H1B" yielded visa lawyer ads instead of motorcycle ads. Instead of calling a meeting, Larry printed the pages, highlighted the bad ads, wrote "THESE ADS SUCK" on top, and posted them on the kitchen wall. By Monday morning at 5:05 AM, engineer Jeff Dean and four colleagues had sent an email with a detailed analysis of the problem, a proposed solution, a working prototype they had coded over the weekend, and sample results showing improvement. Their core insight -- ranking ads by relevance, not just advertiser willingness to pay -- became the foundation of Google's multibillion-dollar AdWords engine. The kicker: none of them were on the ads team.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Culture as the mechanism that enables self-organizing problem-solving without top-down direction. Employees who understand the company mission deeply enough to act on problems outside their formal responsibility. The power of making problems visible rather than routing them through management hierarchies. The combination of a clear mission ("organize the world's information"), individual agency, and freedom to act across team boundaries.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Make problems visible and trust your people to solve them rather than routing everything through management. Hire people who care about the company mission broadly, not just their narrow job description. Create an environment where employees can work on problems outside their team without needing permission. Reward initiative and cross-team problem-solving rather than defending territorial boundaries.</p>
