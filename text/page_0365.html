      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (203) references Art Kleiner's article "The Discipline of Managing Disruption" from strategy+business (March 11, 2013). The article examines how established companies can systematically approach disruption rather than being caught off guard by it.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The concept of "managing disruption" as a discipline suggests that responding to industry upheaval is not a one-time crisis but an ongoing organizational capability. This aligns with the book's argument that companies need to build permanent mechanisms for adaptation and reinvention rather than treating disruption as an exceptional event.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Develop disruption management as a core organizational competency. Regularly scan for emerging threats and opportunities, run scenario-planning exercises, and maintain the organizational agility to pivot when needed. The companies that survive disruption are those that treat adaptation as business-as-usual rather than as an emergency response.</p>
