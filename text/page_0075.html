      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Who decided that an interview should last an hour? Often you know within minutes that a person is wrong for the role. That's why Google interviews are a half hour -- most interviews result in a no-hire decision, so invest less time in them. Good interviewers can make the negative call in thirty minutes. If you like the candidate, schedule another interview or extend on the spot. The shorter time forces substantive discussion with no room for small talk. Not only are most interviews too long, companies conduct too many of them. Google once interviewed a candidate over thirty times and still couldn't decide. They declared by fiat a maximum, then researched the data: each additional interviewer after the fourth increased "decision accuracy" by less than 1 percent. They lowered the maximum to five -- a prime number, which computer scientists appreciate.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The 30-minute interview challenges a deeply ingrained assumption about how long evaluations should take. The data-driven approach to determining optimal interview count (diminishing returns after four) exemplifies Google's culture of using evidence to challenge conventional wisdom. The decision accuracy chart showing a leveling off at 85% after 4 interviews provides concrete justification for limiting the process. Making the process faster and more decisive benefits candidates too -- the best people have options and want to move quickly.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Shorten interviews to 30 minutes and eliminate small talk. Limit interviews to four or five per candidate -- beyond that, you're spending more than you're learning. Schedule 15 minutes after each interview for immediate feedback writing. If you can't decide after five interviews, the answer is probably no. Design the process for speed and clarity: tell interviewers to give immediate thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and design hiring packets that committees can review in two minutes.</p>
