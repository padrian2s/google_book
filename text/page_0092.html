      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Most organizations have impressive archives of written information -- find the best of it and read it. At Google, they advise people to read the founders' 2004 IPO letter and all internal strategy memos, which are the clearest explanations of values and strategy. Don't stop at your company's borders either -- the web has a lot of great written content. Create circles of like-minded smart people to swap books and articles. One of the best ways to get ahead is simply to read more. People who say they don't have time to read are really saying they aren't making it a priority. CEOs read a lot -- think like a CEO and read. Know your elevator pitch: if your manager's boss (or the CEO) asks what you're working on, you have 30 seconds. Your pitch should explain what you're working on, the technical insight driving it, how you measure success (especially customer benefit), and how it fits into the big picture. Job seekers need elevator pitches too -- not condensed resumes but highlights of what you want to do and the impact you'll have.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reading advice connects to the "learning animal" theme -- continuous reading is a hallmark of the kind of intellectual curiosity that defines smart creatives. The elevator pitch requirement serves dual purposes: it forces clarity of thought about your own work, and it creates opportunities for connection with leaders. The emphasis on customer benefit and technical insight in the pitch reflects Google's product-first culture. The distinction between a job-seeker pitch (what you can do and the impact you'll have) and a resume (what you've done) mirrors the growth mindset orientation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Read your company's foundational documents and internal strategy memos. Build a reading habit that includes industry content, strategy, and broad intellectual material. Craft and practice your 30-second elevator pitch covering your work, its technical insight, success metrics, and big-picture fit. Update it regularly. For job searching, create a pitch that highlights your unique value and future impact rather than summarizing your resume. Practice delivering it with conviction until it feels natural.</p>
