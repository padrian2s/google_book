      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google engineers discovered that Eric's profile photo was in a public folder and added Bill Gates' portrait to the background on April Fools' Day. Eric kept it for a month. In 2010, engineers Colin McMillen and Jonathan Feinberg launched Memegen, an internal site where Googlers create and vote on memes commenting acerbically on company affairs. In the tradition of Tom Lehrer and Jon Stewart, Memegen is both very funny and cuts to the heart of company controversies. Examples include memes about Eric, complaints about how things "used to be so much better," ideas for Google Glass apps, and employees revising their OKRs after ambitious project announcements. This isn't manufactured Fun -- it can only exist in a permissive environment that trusts employees and resists the "what happens if this leaks?" worrywarts.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allow and even encourage playful, sometimes pointed commentary about company decisions and leadership. Leaders should demonstrate comfort with being the butt of jokes -- this signals a healthy power dynamic. Create internal platforms where employees can express themselves freely, including criticism. Resist the urge to censor employee expression out of fear that it might leak -- trust is more valuable than control.</p>
