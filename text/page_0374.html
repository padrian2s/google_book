      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (212) references Christopher Chabris and David Goodman's Wall Street Journal article "Chess-Championship Results Show Powerful Role of Computers" (November 22, 2013). The article discusses how computer-assisted chess (centaur chess) demonstrates that the combination of human judgment and computer calculation produces results superior to either alone.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The chess collaboration example illustrates a key theme in the book's conclusion: the future belongs not to humans or computers alone, but to effective human-computer partnerships. This "centaur" model -- where human creativity and intuition complement machine processing power -- represents the authors' vision for how smart creatives will work in the future.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Design workflows that leverage the unique strengths of both humans and computers. Humans excel at creativity, judgment, and contextual understanding; computers excel at processing speed, pattern recognition in large datasets, and consistency. The most powerful outcomes come from thoughtfully combining these complementary strengths.</p>
