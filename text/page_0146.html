      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The timing of failure is the trickiest element. A good failure is a fast one -- once you see a project won't succeed, pull the plug quickly. But an innovative company also gives good ideas plenty of time to gestate. Projects like self-driving cars or Google Fiber have the potential to be highly profitable but will take a very long time. As Jeff Bezos says, "Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue." The key is to iterate very quickly and establish metrics that help judge progress. Small failures should be expected and allowed, but when failures mount and achieving success requires "multiple miracles in a row," it is time to call it a day.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The tension between "fail fast" and "give good ideas time" is resolved through iteration speed and clear metrics. You can pursue long-horizon projects (years or decades) while still failing fast at the iteration level (weeks or months). Each iteration should show whether you're getting closer to success. The "multiple miracles" test is a pragmatic filter -- if achieving your goal requires everything to go right simultaneously, the probability of success approaches zero regardless of the time horizon.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Set long time horizons for big ideas but iterate quickly within that horizon. Establish clear metrics to judge whether each iteration brings you closer to success. When achieving the goal requires "multiple miracles in a row," admit failure and redirect resources. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on details, as Bezos advises.</p>
