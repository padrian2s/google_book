      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 34 cites two academic studies on creativity. A 2003 study by Swann, Kwan, Polzer, and Milton found that group members "displayed the most creativity when the other group members individuated them and offered them verification for their self-views" (Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, November 2003). A 2013 study by Vohs, Redden, and Rahinel showed that messy desks enhance creativity: "Orderliness seemed to encourage a general mind-set for conservatism and tradition, and disorder had the effect of stimulating the desire for the unknown" (Psychological Science, September 2013).</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Treating people as unique individuals rather than interchangeable parts unlocks their creative potential -- a direct argument for the "smart creative" model. The messy desk research supports Google's famously informal, sometimes chaotic work environments as deliberate enablers of innovation. The authors joke about academic jargon while citing rigorous research, maintaining accessibility.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allow employees to express their individuality -- uniformity may feel orderly but can suppress creativity. Do not over-optimize for tidiness in creative environments; some productive disorder can stimulate innovative thinking. Value verification of employees' self-views -- people create best when they feel seen and understood.</p>
