      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Paul Buchheit decided email could be better, he started a 20% project called Caribou (now Gmail). He was told to focus on making Gmail great and worry about revenue later. But Paul ignored this -- Gmail was his baby. He hacked the internal AdWords system to display ads alongside emails. People were initially angry, but the ads turned out to be useful. The technology Paul developed to match ads with emails was later refined into the multibillion-dollar AdSense product. Paul was not punished for his insubordination. The lesson is not that you can ignore management, but that the first step to launching a good idea is building a team of committed peers and starting with a prototype.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Gmail ads story shows how 20% time can produce not just features but entirely new business models through combinatorial innovation (Gmail + AdWords). Paul's "insubordination" worked because he was right and he proved it with a working prototype, not a slide deck. The broader pattern: in a culture that values innovation, stubborn smart creatives sometimes won't take no for an answer -- and that's acceptable when the employee turns out to be right. The Darwinian process starts when you build a prototype and get people excited.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Start with a prototype, not a proposal. Build a team of committed peers around your idea. Understand that the Darwinian process of idea selection requires attracting first followers. Accept that talented people may sometimes ignore direction when they have deep conviction -- judge by results, not obedience.</p>
