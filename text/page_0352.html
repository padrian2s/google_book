      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (190) discusses how the desire to recoup sunk costs leads people to stick with bad courses of action and even double down, a pattern scholars call "escalation of commitment." The note observes that from an individual's perspective, investing based on sunk costs can be rational since it protects the decision-maker's reputation within the organization. It references key academic works by Barry M. Staw and by McAfee, Mialon, and Mialon.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The sunk cost fallacy is one of the most pervasive cognitive biases in business. The endnote makes a subtle but important point: escalation of commitment can be individually rational even when it is organizationally destructive, because admitting a project is doomed can harm the decision-maker's career. This creates a systemic problem that requires cultural solutions -- organizations must make it safe to kill failing projects.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create organizational cultures where killing a failing project is celebrated as good judgment rather than punished as failure. Separate the decision to continue a project from the reputation of the person who initiated it. Use objective metrics and regular reviews to evaluate projects independently of how much has already been invested.</p>
