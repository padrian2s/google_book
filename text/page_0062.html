      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google's founders modeled their hiring after academia rather than corporate America, using committees and focusing on bringing in the best people regardless of role fit. Eric hired Sheryl Sandberg even without a specific job for her -- she went on to build the small business sales team before eventually becoming COO of Facebook. In a peer-based process, the emphasis is on people over roles. The "herd effect" means great people attract more great people. The best workers follow each other. Google's amenities weren't the main draw -- smart creatives came because they wanted to work with the best. This cuts both ways: A's hire A's, but B's hire C's and D's, so compromising standards even once can cascade into mediocrity. The herd effect is especially powerful in early-stage companies where each person's relative importance is magnified.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The herd effect is a self-reinforcing cycle -- quality begets quality, and mediocrity breeds mediocrity. This creates a strong first-mover advantage in talent acquisition: getting great early employees establishes a gravitational pull that makes subsequent hiring easier. The Sheryl Sandberg example demonstrates the "hire the person, not the role" philosophy taken to its extreme. Google's early recruiting phrase "You're brilliant, we're hiring" used reverse psychology (Groucho Marx style) to make the hiring bar itself a recruiting tool.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Set the hiring bar high from the very beginning and never compromise. Use the quality of your existing team as a recruiting tool -- show candidates who they'll be working with. Pay special attention to product hires since they have outsized impact across the company. Create a hiring culture that resists the siren song of compromise, especially during rapid growth when the pressure to fill seats intensifies.</p>
