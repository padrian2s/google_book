      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors shift to career advice, offering wisdom for budding entrepreneurs, new Googlers, and emerging superstars. The first insight: Treat your career like surfing. When Jonathan was in business school, a consumer packaged goods company described product management as "driving forward by looking in your rearview mirror" -- data-driven but backward-looking. Then a Silicon Valley firm described product management as "flying an F-16 at Mach 2 over a boulder-strewn landscape, two meters off the ground" with plenty of quarters to crash and restart. The best industries are the F-16 ones. In business, you need to catch at least one big wave and ride it to shore. People right out of school tend to prioritize company first, then job, then industry -- but this is exactly the wrong order. The right industry is paramount because switching industries is much harder than switching companies.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The surfing metaphor for career management captures the importance of being in the right place (industry) and catching the right wave (company). The F-16 vs. rearview mirror contrast encapsulates the difference between dynamic and static industries. The counterintuitive industry-first advice challenges the common career wisdom that focuses on finding the right company or role. The reasoning is sound: industries determine the available opportunity set, and you'll switch companies multiple times anyway. The most interesting industries are those where product cycle times are accelerating, creating disruption opportunities.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When making career decisions, prioritize industry over company over job title. Choose industries where technology is driving rapid change and creating new opportunities. From a compensation perspective, early career equity is limited so industry expertise is more valuable; later, as equity packages grow, the specific company wave matters more. Don't fear being in the wrong company within the right industry -- the skills and relationships transfer. If you're in a stagnant industry early in your career, consider making a move before your industry expertise locks you in.</p>
