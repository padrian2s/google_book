      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Strategy chapter opens with a provocative claim: whatever your business plan is, it is wrong. MBA-style plans, no matter how well conceived, are always flawed. Following a flawed plan faithfully results in what Eric Ries calls "achieving failure." This is why venture capitalists invest in the team, not the plan -- since the plan is wrong, the people have to be right. Successful teams spot flaws and adjust. Having a plan is fine, but understand it will change. What matters is the foundation: principles grounded in how things actually work today. Jonathan's team at Google -- Marissa Mayer, Salar Kamangar, and Susan Wojcicki -- stopped him from creating a traditional business plan. Instead, they argued the company needed to document its strategic foundation, not its plan. The result was "Google Strategy: Past, Present, and Future."</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The plan-versus-foundation distinction: plans are fluid and will change, but the foundation must be stable. Smart creatives are attracted to "we'll figure it out" flexibility, not rigid plans claiming to have all answers. The venture capital maxim of investing in teams over plans. The importance of documenting strategic foundations rather than detailed operational plans. The principle that rapid iteration guided by strong foundations beats faithful execution of a fixed plan.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Accept that your plan will change and build that flexibility into your approach. Document your strategic foundation -- the principles and insights that will guide adaptation -- rather than creating detailed fixed plans. Hire people who thrive in uncertainty and can adapt, rather than those who need everything mapped out. Use your foundation to attract smart creatives who trust the underlying principles even when specific plans are unwritten.</p>
