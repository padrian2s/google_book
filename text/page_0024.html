      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors challenge readers to recite their company's mission statement and ask whether it feels authentic. They contrast Lehman Brothers' generic mission statement ("unrivaled partnerships... superior results for shareholders") with David Packard's philosophy that companies exist to "do something worthwhile" and "make a contribution to society." People's BS detectors are finely tuned for corporate-speak. A good litmus test: what would happen if you changed the values? Enron's "Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence" could have been changed to "Greed" with no impact. But if Google changed "Focus on the User," outraged engineers would flood the company meeting. The lesson is that values must be authentic and meaningful enough to guide a tired employee making a tough late-night decision.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authenticity test for corporate values: would changing them cause a revolt, or would no one notice? The gap between stated values and lived values as a leading indicator of organizational health (Enron, Lehman Brothers). Values as decision-making tools for employees at all levels, not just inspirational wall art. The importance of constant, authentic communication to reinforce values, as Jack Welch noted: "No vision is worth the paper it's printed on unless it is communicated constantly and reinforced with rewards."</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Apply the "change test" to your company values: if you changed them, would employees revolt? If not, they aren't real values. Write mission statements that are specific enough to actually guide behavior and decision-making. Communicate values constantly through authentic actions, not just posters and guides. Envision a tired employee making a tough decision at midnight -- what values do you want guiding that decision?</p>
