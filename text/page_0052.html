      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Sometimes the best way to grow a platform is to find a specialty with potential to expand. Google grew its search platform by focusing obsessively on one thing: being great at search, measured across five axes -- speed, accuracy, ease of use, comprehensiveness, and freshness. Google was so committed to getting users the right answers that search results included links to competitors (Yahoo, AltaVista, Ask Jeeves) at the bottom of the page. Meanwhile, competitors like Netscape, Yahoo, and AOL were building "portals" -- multifunctional media sites. Google didn't choose search because they predicted it would be more lucrative than portals; they chose it because they were better at it than anyone else. As competitors focused on portal-building, Google search got better and better.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Specialization as a growth strategy -- doing one thing exceptionally well rather than many things adequately. The five-axis measurement framework for search as a model for defining excellence in a specialty. The counterintuitive confidence of linking to competitors to demonstrate commitment to user quality. The "portal trap" -- competitors diversifying into broader but shallower offerings while Google deepened its core competence. Choosing specialization based on capability ("what we're best at") rather than prediction ("what will be most lucrative").</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Identify the one thing you can be best at in the world and focus obsessively on it. Define clear axes for measuring excellence in your specialty. Don't be afraid to link to or acknowledge competitors if doing so demonstrates your commitment to user quality. Resist the temptation to become a "portal" (doing everything) when you should be deepening your specialty. Choose your focus based on where you have the strongest capabilities, not where the market seems biggest.</p>
