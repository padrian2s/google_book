      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors contrast technical insight-driven strategy with conventional approaches. OXO built a business by ergonomically redesigning kitchen tools -- simple but effective technical insights. More often, developing insights is hard, which is why most companies default to the MBA approach of leveraging competitive advantages into adjacent markets. This approach works for incumbents measuring success in percentage points but won't disrupt industries or attract smart creatives. Market research leads to "31 flavors of mediocrity" -- consultants slicing customers into segments while product designers create uninspired variations. At Excite@Home, cable operators used market research showing customers had old PCs to push for supporting outdated technology, missing that Moore's Law would make those PCs obsolete within two years. Worse, market research told them customers wanted "speed" when what they truly loved was "always on" connectivity -- something customers couldn't articulate wanting until they experienced it.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Market research as a backward-looking tool that can't predict paradigm shifts. The failure of asking customers what they want rather than discovering what they need but can't yet conceive. Moore's Law as a force that invalidates market research based on current technology snapshots. The tendency of incumbents to stray from technical insights as they grow, with "suits becoming more important than lab coats." The consultant-driven mediocrity trap of narrow market segmentation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't let market research override technical intuition about where technology is heading. Recognize that customers often can't articulate needs for solutions they haven't experienced. Account for technology trend lines (like Moore's Law) in your planning rather than making decisions based on current technology snapshots. Find the "geeks" in your company -- wherever they are working on new, interesting stuff, that's where your technical insights will come from.</p>
