      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 140 discusses Google's approach to information leaks, particularly around their all-hands TGIF meetings. The authors note that while leaks have occurred, they never originated from TGIF itself. Google tracks down leak sources with a high success rate, and while leaks frequently come from partners, Googlers who leak information are fired.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note reveals the tension between radical transparency within an organization and the need to protect sensitive information from reaching the outside world. Google's approach demonstrates that open internal communication requires strong enforcement mechanisms to prevent external leaks, creating a culture of trust balanced with accountability.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Organizations that practice radical internal transparency must pair it with clear consequences for breaching external confidentiality. Establish strong leak-tracking capabilities and communicate the consequences clearly so employees understand that open internal dialogue depends on everyone respecting the boundary between internal and external communication.</p>
