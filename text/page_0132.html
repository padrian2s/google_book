      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Google acquired Motorola in 2012, Jonathan attended a three-hour product review where managers kept referring to "customer requirements." Over lunch, an exec explained that when Motorola said "customers," they meant the mobile carriers like Verizon and AT&T, not the people who actually use the phones. Motorola was focusing on its partners, not its users. At Google, users are the people who use products, while customers are companies that buy advertising. When there are conflicts between the two, the bias is always toward the user. Users are more empowered than ever and won't tolerate crummy products.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Motorola example starkly illustrates what happens when a company confuses its users with its customers. By focusing on carrier requirements rather than end-user needs, Motorola produced phones that satisfied business partners but disappointed actual users. This distinction is critical in any business with intermediaries or multi-sided markets. The company that focuses on the end user will ultimately win, because in the Internet Century, users have more power and choice than ever.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Clearly distinguish between your users and your customers. When they conflict, bias toward the user. Regularly check that product decisions are driven by user needs, not intermediary requirements. Be suspicious when "customer requirements" don't align with what end users actually want -- it may mean you're optimizing for the wrong constituency.</p>
