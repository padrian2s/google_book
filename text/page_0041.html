      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Israeli tank commanders don't yell "Charge!" -- they shout "Ah'cha'rye," meaning "Follow me." Leaders of smart creatives must adopt this attitude. The authors illustrate with examples of leaders who demonstrate commitment through action: Mark Zuckerberg eating dinner at his computer at 7 PM while continuing to work; Google engineer Urs Holzle picking up small bits of trash in the hallway; CEOs who pick up newspapers at the front door and founders who wipe counters. These actions demonstrate egalitarian commitment -- leaders are not above menial tasks. But mostly, they demonstrate that leaders care deeply about the company. Leadership requires passion -- if you don't have it, get out now.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Leadership by example as the only credible form of leadership for smart creatives. The "follow me" principle: leaders go first, they don't direct from behind. Small symbolic actions (picking up trash, wiping counters) as powerful signals of commitment and egalitarianism. The connection between passion and credibility -- smart creatives can detect whether a leader truly cares. Commitment as a prerequisite, not an aspiration.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Lead from the front, not from behind -- demonstrate the work ethic and commitment you expect from others. Perform small, visible acts that signal you are not above any task. Show your commitment through sustained action, not speeches. If you don't have genuine passion for your venture, recognize that smart creatives will see through any performance -- better to step aside than to fake it.</p>
