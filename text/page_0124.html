      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The iPhone launched in June 2007 as a nearly perfect product. Later that year, the Android team posted a YouTube video showing their work, and Steve Jobs concluded the user experience was too similar to iOS. Eric stepped down from the Apple board in August 2009 and legal skirmishes continue. Eventually everyone will have a smartphone running either iOS or Android. Steve Jobs saw this future with great clarity -- he embodied a combination of technical depth, artistic and creative talent, and business savvy that allowed him to create products people fell in love with. He merged beauty and science in a tech community with lots of nerds and business people but very few artists.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Android/iOS saga demonstrates two fundamentally different approaches to innovation. Apple bet on controlling the entire user experience through a closed system. Google bet on the superior economics of an open platform. Both are tremendously innovative, both eschew traditional market research, and both place the highest priority on creating the best consumer experience. The key difference is control -- Apple's excellence comes from maintaining complete control, while Android's power comes from being open to anyone.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Choose your innovation model deliberately -- open platform or controlled ecosystem -- based on your strengths and market dynamics. Both can work spectacularly. Don't assume your approach is the only valid one. Study the Steve Jobs counterexample honestly: if you have his extraordinary instinct and taste, a highly controlled model can yield tremendous innovation. If not, consider more open approaches.</p>
