      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Lawyers are by training backward-looking and risk-averse -- precedent determines what's OK, and the job of a corporate law firm is to keep clients out of trouble. When you ask most lawyers to assess a situation that's 99 percent good and 1 percent questionable, they spend most of their time on the questionable part. A legal disclaimer sign at Google's athletic fields illustrated this perfectly -- a quarter of the sign was taken up by legalese. But the backward-looking, risk-averse approach doesn't work in the Internet Century, where business evolves orders of magnitude faster than legal change. Google's legal team, led by David Drummond, Kulpreet Rana, and Miriam Rivera, created an environment of "horseback law" -- like a cowboy surveying the situation from his horse, making a quick assessment, and riding on. In early stages of new projects, quick legal guidance beats fifty-page briefs covering every conceivable risk.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "horseback law" concept adapts legal practice to the speed of technology business without abandoning legal rigor for major decisions. It recognizes that the traditional legal approach (exhaustive analysis before any action) creates bottlenecks that slow innovation. The cowboy metaphor captures the balance between assessment and action. The approach requires lawyers who are integral parts of business teams rather than outside advisors called in occasionally. It also requires generalist lawyers comfortable with ambiguity, not specialists seeking certainty -- mirroring the hiring philosophy for all smart creatives.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Integrate lawyers into your business and product teams rather than keeping them as separate advisors. Hire legal generalists who are comfortable with ambiguity and can make quick assessments. For early-stage projects, seek quick legal guidance rather than exhaustive analysis -- the analysis won't be 100 percent correct anyway. Reserve deep legal analysis for major decisions like acquisitions and compliance questions. Do the right thing by consumers and customers, which reduces legal risk more than any amount of defensive lawyering.</p>
