      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Sergey's investigative team confirmed in early January that hackers had tried to steal source code and compromise Gmail accounts of Chinese political dissidents. Sergey felt it was important to announce the attack and respond quickly. In Eric's staff meeting, Sergey forcefully argued for stopping compliance with censorship policies and halting search filtering on Google.cn, even if the government would likely shut down the site. He stood up to deliver his point -- unusual since he usually stood only when wearing Rollerblades. Eric counseled the team to consider all data and come prepared to the next meeting. On Sunday January 10, 2010, Eric convened an urgent meeting at 4 PM. After hours of heated discussion, Eric called for a vote. Though not necessary (Eric knew Larry was on Sergey's side), he felt every person needed to record their position. The majority sided with Sergey.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Eric's handling of the China decision exemplifies the ideal decision-making process: gathering data, allowing heated debate, ensuring every voice is heard, and then making the call. The decision to call a formal vote even when the outcome was predetermined shows the importance of process legitimacy -- people need to feel their position was recorded, not just assumed. Eric's willingness to orchestrate a process whose outcome he opposed demonstrates extraordinary leadership maturity. The urgency of the Sunday meeting and the hours-long discussion show that important decisions deserve proportionate time investment.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When leading a critical decision, give the team time to gather data but set a clear deadline. Allow heated debate and ensure everyone's voice is heard regardless of their position. Even when the outcome seems predetermined, give people the chance to formally register their position. If you disagree with the likely outcome, focus on process integrity rather than outcome manipulation. Remember that how a decision is made affects whether people will rally behind it.</p>
