      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 180 describes Google's internal idea submission system, which allows members to vote on ideas and automatically tabulates votes so good ideas rise up a leaderboard. Kevin's proposal, called "URL and Query Autocompletion (with Demos)," was the 917th submission to the list, which at last count numbered over fifteen thousand submissions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note illustrates how Google systematized the "ship and iterate" approach to innovation from the bottom up. The internal ideas list represents a marketplace of ideas where meritocracy -- through voting and leaderboard rankings -- determines which proposals get attention and resources. The sheer volume (over 15,000 submissions) demonstrates the depth of engagement from employees in Google's innovation ecosystem.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create formal channels for bottom-up idea generation that include transparent ranking mechanisms. A well-designed internal ideas platform allows good ideas to surface regardless of who proposed them, democratizing innovation. Include voting, commenting, and visibility features so that the best ideas gain momentum organically. The system itself becomes a tool for identifying both good ideas and innovative thinkers.</p>
