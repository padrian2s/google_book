      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 163 addresses the concern of companies that cannot afford to ship products without associated revenue. The authors acknowledge that not every company has Google's resources, but argue that the "focus on the user" principle still applies. They advise being scrappy, investing as little as possible until an idea is proven, and then treating the path to profits as a financing decision backed by sound data on proven user value.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This note demonstrates the authors' awareness that their advice must be adapted for companies of different sizes and resource levels. The underlying principle -- focus on users first, then figure out monetization -- remains constant, but the implementation varies based on available resources. The concept of "being scrappy" until proving user value is essentially the lean startup methodology applied to the user-first philosophy.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Even with limited resources, prioritize proving user value before investing heavily. Use minimum viable products and rapid experimentation to validate ideas cheaply. Once user value is demonstrated with real data, the question of funding becomes a more straightforward business decision rather than a speculative bet. This approach reduces risk while maintaining a user-first orientation.</p>
