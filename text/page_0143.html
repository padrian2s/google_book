      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Once good ideas emerge from the primordial ooze, the next step is to ship them. Voltaire wrote "The perfect is the enemy of the good," and Steve Jobs told the Macintosh team that "real artists ship." New ideas are never perfect right out of the chute -- create a product, ship it, see how it does, design and implement improvements, and push it back out. Ship and iterate. When Google launched AdWords, there was a debate about whether ads should go live without internal review. The ship-and-iterate approach won, allowing advertisers to see performance data immediately and improve their ads. The approach worked.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Ship and iterate works in any realm where the cost of experimentation has dropped. With digital products, iteration is nearly free. But even with 3-D printing and online modeling, the approach is increasingly feasible for physical products. The hardest part is iterating -- it's easy to rally a team to ship something new, but much harder to get them to stick around for the hard work of improvement. One form of motivation that works is negative feedback, though finding the right amount of criticism is a fine line.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Launch products when they are good enough, not perfect. Focus on early user traction rather than comprehensive functionality. Keep marketing minimal at launch -- let the product prove itself. Plan for iteration from day one, and make sure teams are committed to improvement, not just launch excitement. Use data to decide quickly which efforts are winners and which are losers.</p>
