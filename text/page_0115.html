      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Bill Campbell suggested an approach to one-on-one meetings: both the manager and employee independently write down their top five items to cover. When the lists are revealed, overlapping items identify shared priorities, and divergences reveal potential problems. Bill also recommended a structured 1:1 format covering four areas: (1) Performance on job requirements (sales, delivery, customer feedback, budget), (2) Relationship with peer groups (cross-functional collaboration), (3) Management/Leadership (coaching, weeding out poor performers, hiring, inspiring heroic work), and (4) Innovation/Best Practices (continuous improvement, evaluating new technologies, benchmarking against the best).</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "match the lists" technique is elegant because it surfaces misalignment without confrontation. If a manager and direct report cannot independently identify the same top problems, the relationship itself needs attention. The four-category framework ensures 1:1s cover both tactical performance and strategic growth, preventing meetings from becoming status updates rather than problem-solving sessions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Before each 1:1, write your top five discussion items independently. Compare lists at the start of the meeting and prioritize overlapping concerns. Structure the conversation around performance metrics, cross-team relationships, leadership development, and innovation. If lists consistently diverge, treat it as an early warning signal of a deeper alignment problem.</p>
