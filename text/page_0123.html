      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The Innovation chapter opens with Eric sitting at a Palo Alto intersection in March 2010, reflecting after having coffee with Steve Jobs at Calafia restaurant. They had discussed Google's growing mobile operating system, Android. Steve was convinced Android was built on Apple's intellectual property. Eric knew this wasn't true but could see "they are going to fight us." The story traces Eric and Steve's relationship from 1993 at Sun and NeXT, through Eric joining the Apple board in 2006, to the growing tension as Android and iPhone evolved from very different products into direct competitors.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This opening narrative sets up the chapter's central theme: innovation can take radically different forms. The Apple-Google relationship illustrates how two innovative companies can take opposing approaches -- Apple's closed, controlled ecosystem versus Google's open platform -- and both achieve massive success. The personal relationship between Eric and Steve adds human complexity to what is often framed as a purely business conflict.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Recognize that there is no single right approach to innovation. Study competitors not to copy them but to understand the different valid approaches to solving the same problems. Personal relationships between leaders of competing companies can coexist with fierce business competition. Be prepared that innovation paths that start differently can converge and create conflict.</p>
