      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Everyone knows someone truly exceptional -- someone who climbed K2, published a novel, coded top-100 apps, or danced onstage with Bruno Mars. If everyone knows at least one great person, and everyone they work with knows one too, why let only recruiters handle recruiting? Establishing a successful hiring culture starts with understanding that sourcing candidates isn't exclusively the recruiters' realm. The job of finding people belongs to everyone and must be woven into the fabric of the company. Recruiters manage the process, but everyone should be recruited into recruiting. At around five hundred employees, managers start worrying more about headcount allocation than finding great people. Larry Page often said it's easy for any company to double in size with great people -- all it takes is for each employee to refer just one great person.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "everyone knows someone great" insight transforms recruiting from a specialized function into a company-wide responsibility. The observation about the five-hundred-employee inflection point, where "fighting for headcount" replaces "finding great people," identifies a specific organizational pathology that undermines hiring quality. The solution is measurement: count referrals and interviews, measure feedback form completion speed, track recruiting event participation, and tie these metrics to performance reviews and promotions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Make recruiting everyone's job by measuring and rewarding recruiting activities in performance reviews. Count referrals, interview participation, and feedback timeliness. Keep a stack of great resumes to show candidates during the closing process -- demonstrate the caliber of people they'd be joining. When completely delegating recruiting to recruiters, quality degrades because recruiters don't live with their mistakes the way the hiring team does. Resist the shift from "finding great people" to "fighting for headcount" as your company grows.</p>
