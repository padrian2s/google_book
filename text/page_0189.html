      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 29 provides the history of HP's Little Basin campsite. In 2007, HP sold the site to two nonprofits -- Sempervirens Fund and Peninsula Open Space Trust -- who then sold it to the California state parks department. Today it is part of Big Basin Redwoods State Park and open for public use, as reported by Paul Rogers in the San Jose Mercury News (January 14, 2011).</p>
