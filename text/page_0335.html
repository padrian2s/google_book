      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 173 references Andy Grove's discussion of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) in his book High Output Management (1983). Grove, the legendary CEO of Intel, developed the OKR framework as a management tool for setting and tracking objectives and their measurable outcomes, which later became foundational to Google's management approach.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The OKR system represents one of the most concrete management tools the authors advocate. Its origins at Intel under Grove, and its transmission to Google through venture capitalist John Doerr, illustrates how management innovations propagate through Silicon Valley's ecosystem. OKRs embody the book's principles of transparency, measurability, and ambitious goal-setting in a practical, implementable framework.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Implement OKRs to create alignment and accountability across your organization. Set ambitious objectives with measurable key results, make them visible to everyone, and review them regularly. The power of OKRs lies in their simplicity and transparency: everyone can see what everyone else is working toward, creating natural alignment without heavy top-down management.</p>
