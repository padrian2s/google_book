      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors challenge the conventional notion of "work-life balance," arguing the phrase itself is problematic because work is an important part of life, not something to be separated. The best cultures invite people to be "overworked in a good way" with too many interesting things to do both at work and at home. Rather than enforcing forty-hour weeks, managers should give people responsibility and freedom, trusting them to own their work. Marissa Mayer argues that burnout isn't caused by working too hard but by resentment at having to give up what really matters. Small teams help because teammates sense when someone is burning out. The authors also caution against "indispensable" employees who refuse to take vacations -- make them take time off and ensure their backup fills in, building organizational resilience.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reframing of work-life balance as work-life integration. The distinction between imposed overwork (leading to resentment and burnout) and chosen overwork (driven by passion and ownership). The manager's role as creating conditions for engagement, not enforcing time boundaries. Small teams as natural burnout detectors. The danger of "indispensable" employees who create single points of failure. Maternity and paternity leave as a hidden benefit for organizational resilience.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Give people ownership and freedom rather than managing their hours. Watch for burnout signals but address the root cause (resentment about lost priorities) rather than the symptom (long hours). Force "indispensable" people to take vacations and ensure their backups can fill in. Use small teams as natural social networks that detect when members need support. Recognize that intense work periods are acceptable when they alternate with recovery periods.</p>
