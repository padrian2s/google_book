      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Sometimes it takes more than interesting side projects to keep people engaged. You need to prioritize the interests of highly valued individuals over organizational constraints. Salar Kamangar, hired straight out of Stanford by the founders, helped invent AdWords and spent years in the product organization. When he wanted to expand into general management but no suitable role existed, Google created one -- appointing him head of YouTube. This pattern repeated with numerous other cases where smart creatives needed something new and the company found a way to make it happen. The principle: do the best thing for the person and make the organization adjust. Encouraging job movement through rotations works well in small programs like the APM program, but it's harder to implement across large organizations. Google's approach has been to make movement as easy as possible and make it a standard management discussion topic.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Salar Kamangar story (creating the YouTube role specifically for him) demonstrates the ultimate expression of "hire the person, not the role" extended to retention. Rather than losing a talented person because no role exists, you create the role. The tension between individual rotation benefits and organizational stability is acknowledged honestly -- managers naturally resist losing their best people. The solution of making rotation a standard management discussion topic rather than a formal program shows pragmatism about what works at scale.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When a top performer outgrows their role, create a new one rather than losing them. Make internal mobility a regular topic in management discussions and one-on-ones. Ensure that rotation discussions focus on the best performers, not underperformers. Remove barriers to internal movement -- if it's easier to leave the company than to change teams, you have a structural problem. Accept that some organizational disruption from talent rotation is a small price for retaining your best people.</p>
