      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (189) explains Steve Jobs's famous maxim "Real artists ship." For those outside the tech industry, "ship" means sending a product to customers. Jobs's point was that while polishing work to perfection can be tempting, you have not accomplished anything until your work reaches actual customers.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "ship it" mentality connects directly to the previous note about perfect being the enemy of good. In technology, the gap between a brilliant prototype and a product in users' hands is where many innovations die. Jobs understood that execution and delivery are what separate dreamers from achievers, and Google embraced this same principle in its rapid iteration cycles.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Set firm deadlines for getting products into users' hands. Track "time to ship" as a key metric. When teams are stuck in endless refinement cycles, remind them that real value is only created when customers can actually use the product. Build a culture that celebrates launches, not just ideas.</p>
