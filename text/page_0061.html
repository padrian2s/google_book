      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google's leaders pursued interviewing with the same intensity for every candidate, whether entry-level software engineer or senior executive. Yet most managers, despite having gone through extensive hiring processes themselves, do everything to avoid being involved in hiring others -- delegating resume review, treating interviewing as a chore, and pushing feedback forms to late Friday. The higher up you go, the more detached executives get from hiring, when the inverse should be true. The traditional hierarchical hiring model (where the hiring manager decides) is problematic because once hired, the working model is collaborative. A single hiring manager's decision impacts numerous teams. Leaders often say they hire people smarter than themselves, but hierarchical hiring rarely achieves this due to human nature -- the emotional fear of being outshone overrides rational hiring decisions.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The disconnect between how people experienced their own hiring (extensive process) and how they approach hiring others (minimal involvement) reveals a fundamental cognitive bias. The critique of hierarchical hiring exposes how organizational structures designed for control conflict with the collaborative reality of modern work. The humorous hyphenated decision chain ("let's-hire-this-guy-because-he's-so-smart" vs. "but-then-he-might-be-better-than-me") honestly addresses the ego-driven dynamics that undermine hiring quality.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Senior leaders should spend more time on hiring, not less. Submit interview feedback within 24 hours while impressions are fresh. Adopt a peer-based hiring model with committee decisions instead of giving one hiring manager sole authority. Use academia as a model -- universities invest heavily in faculty hiring through committees because they can't easily undo bad decisions. Focus on bringing the best people into the company even if their experience doesn't match an open role.</p>
