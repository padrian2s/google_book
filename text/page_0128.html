      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>When Yahoo decided it wasn't innovative enough, they did what MBA types do: put someone in charge of fixing it. Udi Manber was offered the head of innovation role, but three weeks in realized his job was to set up an innovation bureaucracy -- an oxymoron. He left and eventually came to Google. The idea of a Chief Innovation Officer is fundamentally flawed because innovation cannot be owned, mandated, or scheduled. As Udi said, "Innovative people do not need to be told to do it, they need to be allowed to do it." Innovation evolves organically like natural selection for ideas -- its defining characteristic is its lack of process.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The CEO-as-CIO principle reflects a fundamental insight: innovation cannot be delegated. Creating an innovation department is like creating a department of fun -- the very act of institutionalizing it kills the thing you're trying to create. The Darwin metaphor is powerful: ideas, like species, compete for survival. More ideas are born than can possibly survive, and only those that prove themselves survive. There is no process to implement this evolution; you can only create the environment (the "primordial ooze") where it can happen.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Don't appoint a head of innovation or create an innovation council. Instead, the CEO must own innovation culture directly. Create an environment where ideas can freely collide, then give new creations time and freedom to evolve. Accept that most ideas will die -- that's the point. Focus on creating the conditions for innovation rather than trying to manage innovation itself.</p>
