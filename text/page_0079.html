      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>In compiling hiring packets, details matter. Does the school's GPA use a four-point or six-point scale? Class rank matters for recent graduates due to grade inflation. The packet must be well-formatted with best and worst answers highlighted, and original resumes included as-is (typos, formatting errors, and all). Even data-based packets can be biased -- one interviewer's 3.8 is another's 2.9. The solution is more data: include statistics on each interviewer's past scores (number of interviews, range, and mean) so committee members can calibrate. When Google instituted committees, some managers who wanted absolute control hated it and threatened to leave. The response: that's OK, because dictatorial tendencies rarely contain themselves to one aspect of work. Promotions should also be committee-based for the same reasons. Committees also provide a buffer for conflict-averse smart creatives who have a hard time saying no to promotion requests.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The attention to detail in hiring packets (GPA scales, class rankings, original resume formatting) reflects the broader principle that getting the details right enables getting the big decisions right. Including interviewer statistics is a sophisticated approach to calibration that accounts for individual bias without requiring everyone to score identically. The willingness to let managers who oppose committee hiring leave demonstrates the depth of commitment to the system. The extension of committee-based decisions to promotions shows consistency in applying peer-based evaluation across all people decisions.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Track interviewer statistics over time and include them in hiring packets for calibration. Pay attention to formatting and presentation details in candidate materials -- they signal thoroughness and professionalism. Accept that some managers will resist committee-based hiring, and be willing to let them leave rather than compromise the system. Apply committee-based decision-making to promotions as well as hiring. Use the committee structure to give conflict-averse team members cover for difficult decisions.</p>
