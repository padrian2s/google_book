      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Ten percent also works because creativity loves constraints. It's why pictures have frames and sonnets have fourteen lines. Henry Ford set pricing low to force manufacturing innovation: "We make more discoveries concerning manufacturing and selling under this forced method than by any method of leisurely investigation." In 2002, Larry Page began wondering if it was possible to make every book ever published searchable online. Rather than assigning a team with a big budget, he got a digital camera, rigged it to a tripod, and started snapping pictures while Marissa Mayer turned pages. This crude prototype proved the project was feasible. Google Books was born.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Larry's scrappy prototype embodies the principle that constraints spur innovation. His DIY approach, built from parts purchased at Fry's, proved more cost-efficient than advanced systems would have been. As Frank Lloyd Wright observed, "The human race built most nobly when limitations were greatest." Overfunding an innovation project can actually hobble it -- the budget becomes the project rather than the idea. The Google Books and Street View stories share the same DNA: start scrappy, prove feasibility, then scale.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Embrace resource constraints as innovation drivers. Start with crude prototypes to prove feasibility before investing heavily. Resist the urge to overfund new projects -- a lack of resources forces ingenuity. Apply Henry Ford's forced method: set ambitious constraints that require breakthrough thinking rather than incremental optimization.</p>
