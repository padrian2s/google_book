      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google[x] uses a three-part Venn diagram to evaluate ideas: the idea must address a big challenge affecting hundreds of millions or billions of people, must propose a solution radically different from anything in the market, and must rely on breakthrough technologies that are at least feasible and achievable in the not-too-distant future. Project Loon (broadband via helium balloons) checks all three boxes. Innovation also requires the right market context -- large, fast-growing markets full of competition. Don't look for empty space; it is much better to enter a space that is or will be large. Google was late to the search engine party, not early.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The Google[x] framework provides a disciplined approach to evaluating moonshot ideas while the market context advice is counterintuitive -- most entrepreneurs dream of "greenfield" markets with no competition, but usually there's a reason the market is empty. The Gmail example shows how context matters: Paul Buchheit was innovating into a large and growing space (email) by betting Google could build a browser-based system as rich as desktop clients. Google had the engineering talent to execute, making the context perfect for innovation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Evaluate ideas against three criteria: big problem, radical solution, feasible technology. Innovate in large, competitive markets rather than empty niches. Consider whether you have the talent to execute on the technology bet. Ask how technology in your space will evolve and whether you can create sustainable differentiation within that evolution.</p>
