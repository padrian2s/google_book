      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 143 shares quotes from Urs Holzle's "user manual" -- a personal guide he created to help colleagues understand his communication style. Urs explains his directness (rooted in his non-US upbringing), his tendency to overstate points for clarity, his insistence that people tell him when he is wrong, and his acknowledgment that negative feedback is rarely intentional.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The concept of a personal "user manual" for leaders is a powerful transparency tool. It acknowledges that everyone has different communication styles and that making these explicit can prevent misunderstandings. Urs's manual embodies the Google principle of defaulting to openness -- even about one's own potential weaknesses and interpersonal quirks.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Consider creating your own "user manual" that explains your communication style, preferences, and potential blind spots. Share it with your team to foster better understanding and more effective collaboration. Encourage others to do the same, creating a culture where direct communication is expected and personality differences are navigated openly rather than becoming sources of friction.</p>
