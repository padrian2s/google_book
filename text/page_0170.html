      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The endnotes continue with references including citations about Silicon Valley funding in the 1980s-90s requiring a Microsoft strategy, Susan Wojcicki's first Google title being "landlord," Peter Drucker's definition of business purpose ("to create a customer"), Steve Ballmer's Microsoft reorganization, and the technical challenges of building Google's infrastructure (described as "repeatedly climbing a rapidly growing mountain of data, needing to reach the top faster each time"). These notes provide scholarly and journalistic foundations for the book's arguments.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The endnotes reveal interesting details that enrich the main text -- like Susan Wojcicki literally being Google's landlord before becoming one of its most important executives, or the vivid metaphor of climbing a growing data mountain. The Drucker reference connects Google's "focus on the user" philosophy to established management theory, showing that while Google's approach felt revolutionary, it was consistent with foundational business principles about creating customer value.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Connect innovative practices to established management principles -- it adds credibility and helps traditionalists understand the approach. Pay attention to origin stories (like Wojcicki's landlord-to-leader journey) as they reveal organizational values. Use vivid metaphors (like the growing data mountain) to make technical challenges relatable to non-technical audiences.</p>
