      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One way to expand the aperture is to judge candidates on trajectory rather than current position. The best people are often those whose careers are climbing, because projecting their path forward shows potential for great growth. Strong experienced people who have hit a plateau offer predictability but less potential for the extraordinary. Age and trajectory are not correlated, and there are exceptions like entrepreneurs and those with nontraditional paths. Expanding the aperture becomes harder as you go up the corporate food chain because senior hiring is almost always experience-based. But in most industries, technology has made the environment so dynamic that relevant experience is only part of success. Companies consistently overvalue relevant experience for senior candidates.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The trajectory-over-position framework is a practical application of the "hire learning animals" principle -- people on an upward trajectory are demonstrating continuous learning in action. The observation that companies overvalue relevant experience for senior hires is counterintuitive but well-supported by the argument that dynamic environments make past experience less predictive of future success. This represents a systematic bias in traditional hiring that creates opportunities for companies willing to think differently about senior talent.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When evaluating candidates, plot their career trajectory rather than just assessing their current position. For senior hires, resist the temptation to require extensive directly relevant experience -- focus more on what talented smart creatives can bring to the role. Look for candidates who have repeatedly taken on new challenges and succeeded in unfamiliar territory. Be willing to hire brilliant generalists for senior positions even when they lack traditional industry experience.</p>
