      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 38 traces the "obligation to dissent" to Shona Brown, who brought the concept from her years at McKinsey and Company. McKinsey's website states that all consultants are obligated to dissent if they believe something is incorrect or not in the best interests of the client, and that everyone's opinion counts regardless of seniority.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Making dissent not just permitted but obligatory inverts the typical organizational dynamic where conformity is the path of least resistance. Brown bringing McKinsey's dissent culture to Google illustrates how management practices travel between organizations through key hires. Codifying dissent as an obligation creates structural psychological safety.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Make dissent an explicit expectation, not just a tolerated behavior -- obligate team members to voice disagreements. Hire leaders from organizations with strong management cultures; they bring valuable practices with them. Create forums and norms where challenging ideas is the default, especially for junior team members who may hesitate to disagree.</p>
