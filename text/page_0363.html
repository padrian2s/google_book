      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (201) references the Wall Street Journal article "Bookseller Borders Begins a New Chapter... 11" by Joseph Checkler and Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg (February 17, 2011), reporting on Borders Group filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The clever headline underscores the irony of a bookseller's demise being described in literary terms.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Borders' bankruptcy is a cautionary tale of a company that failed to adapt to technological disruption. While Amazon built a digital platform, Borders outsourced its online sales to Amazon -- effectively handing its future to a competitor. This exemplifies the book's warnings about companies that fail to bet on technical insights and build their own platforms.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Never outsource your core strategic capabilities, especially in technology. Borders' decision to let Amazon handle its online business was a fatal strategic error. Identify which technological capabilities are essential to your future and invest in building them in-house, even if outsourcing seems more efficient in the short term.</p>
