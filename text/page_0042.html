      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Six months into his role, Eric witnessed the power of "Don't be evil" firsthand. During a debate about a potentially lucrative advertising change, an engineering lead pounded the table and said "We can't do that, it would be evil." The room went silent. A long, contentious discussion followed, and the change was rejected. The mantra, coined by engineers Paul Buchheit and Amit Patel, is mainly a tool for employee empowerment -- like Toyota's kanban system where any assembly line worker can pull the cord to stop production when they spot a quality problem. Every company needs a cultural lodestar that shines above all management layers and office politics. When an engineer calls something "evil," they are pulling the cord to force everyone to assess whether a decision is consistent with company values. The best cultures are aspirational -- there will be failures, but more cases where people overdeliver, raising the bar each time.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>"Don't be evil" as an empowerment mechanism, not just a moral statement -- analogous to Toyota's production line cord. The cultural lodestar as the ultimate decision-making framework that transcends hierarchy and politics. The power of giving any employee the authority to halt decisions that violate values. Aspirational culture as a self-reinforcing cycle: overdelivery raises the bar, which inspires more overdelivery. The distinction between a culture that is perfect and one that aspires to be better.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Create your own "Don't be evil" -- a simple, memorable cultural lodestar that any employee can invoke to challenge decisions. Give every employee the power to "pull the cord" when they see something inconsistent with company values. Make your values aspirational rather than descriptive -- aim for what you want to be, not just what you are. Accept that there will be failures in living up to your values, but use each success to raise the bar higher.</p>
