      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The glossary captures Google's distinctive organizational language. Terms like "obligation to dissent" codify cultural expectations into memorable phrases. "Smart creative" provides a label for the type of employee the entire book is about -- someone who combines technical depth with business acumen and creativity.

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Adopt the "obligation to dissent" principle in your organization -- make it a cultural expectation that people must speak up when they see problems. Define what "smart creative" means for your industry and hire accordingly. Create your own organizational vocabulary that encodes your cultural values into memorable, shareable terms.</p>
