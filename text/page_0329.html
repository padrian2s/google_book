      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors cite DARPA as an exemplar of how to organize for breakthrough innovation. Despite being a government agency, DARPA has consistently produced transformative technologies (including the Internet itself) through a unique model of empowering small teams, setting audacious goals, and accepting high failure rates. This model parallels many of the principles the authors advocate for corporate innovation.</p>
