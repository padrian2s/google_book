      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 157 references work by Adi Alon, North American managing director of Accenture's Innovation Performance group, including a TMC News article "10 Ways to Achieve Growth Through Innovation" and a Forbes piece arguing that companies need a Chief Innovation Officer. These sources provide a consulting perspective on institutionalizing innovation within large organizations.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The authors reference mainstream consulting perspectives on innovation to contrast them with Google's approach. While consultants often recommend formal innovation roles and processes, the Google model embeds innovation throughout the organization rather than isolating it in a dedicated function. This tension between formalized and organic innovation approaches is a key theme.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Rather than creating a separate "innovation department," focus on building innovation into your organization's DNA through hiring practices, cultural norms, and structural incentives. Innovation should be everyone's responsibility, not the domain of a single executive or team. If you do appoint an innovation leader, their primary job should be enabling innovation across the organization, not owning it.</p>
