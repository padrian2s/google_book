      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Reorganizations are among the most despised corporate activities -- companies lurch between centralized and decentralized structures, functional and divisional, in an endless cycle. Google's approach: keep organizations flat. The "rule of seven" at Google means managers should have a minimum of seven direct reports (most have more), forcing flatter charts with less managerial oversight and more employee freedom. Larry and Sergey once tried abolishing managers entirely (a "dis-org" where the head of engineering had 130 direct reports), but even smart creatives need some formal structure. The key principle: with enough direct reports, there simply isn't time to micromanage, which is exactly the point.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The reorg death spiral: no perfect organizational structure exists, so companies perpetually restructure without solving underlying problems. The "rule of seven" as minimum direct reports (opposite of the traditional maximum) to enforce flatness. The failed experiment of eliminating managers entirely -- even smart creatives need some structure. The design principle of using org structure to prevent micromanagement by making it physically impossible. The preference for guidelines over rigid rules in organizational design.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Set minimum (not maximum) direct report counts for managers to enforce flat structures. Resist the temptation to reorganize as a solution to business problems -- most problems aren't structural. When reorgs are necessary, do them quickly and let smart creatives work out the details. Keep the organization functionally organized as long as possible to prevent silos and preserve information flow.</p>
