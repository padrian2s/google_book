      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The authors describe three converging technology trends that have fundamentally shifted the business landscape: ubiquitous free information via the Internet, global mobile connectivity, and cloud computing providing infinite computing power on demand. These trends have made the previously impossible routine -- from phones that remind you about flights and translate languages, to virtual museum tours and free global video calls. The authors contrast their 1970s/80s college experience of expensive weekly phone calls home with their children's era of free video hangouts across continents. What's most remarkable is that these astonishing capabilities are no longer considered astonishing at all.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The convergence of three technology waves (information, connectivity, computing) creating compounding effects. The normalization of the extraordinary -- innovations become invisible once adopted. The transition from scarcity (scarce information, limited connectivity, expensive computing) to abundance as the defining shift of the Internet Century. The democratization of capabilities that were once exclusive to large organizations or the wealthy.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Build strategies that assume information abundance rather than scarcity. Design products and services for a world where everyone has a powerful connected computer in their pocket. Recognize that the next five billion people coming online represents both a challenge and a massive opportunity. Look for business models built on scarcity assumptions -- these are vulnerable to disruption.</p>
