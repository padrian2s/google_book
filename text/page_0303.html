      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 141 references a New York Times article by John Markoff about the match between IBM's Watson computer and human Jeopardy! contestants. Larry Brown's comment was meant to downplay Watson's significance, and the authors note the irony that the game of Jeopardy! itself requires asking questions -- a fitting metaphor for the kind of curiosity-driven culture the book advocates.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The note highlights the recurring theme of artificial intelligence challenging human capabilities, a topic that underscores the book's emphasis on the accelerating pace of technological change. The ironic observation about Jeopardy! being about asking questions connects to the authors' belief that asking the right questions is more important than having all the answers.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Embrace rather than dismiss technological advances, even when they threaten established ways of doing things. The ability to ask the right questions -- a core skill for smart creatives -- becomes even more important as AI and machine learning handle more routine cognitive tasks.</p>
