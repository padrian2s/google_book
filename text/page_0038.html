      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This page continues showing examples of Google's internal meme culture through Memegen. After ambitious projects like Project Loon (balloon-powered Internet) were announced, employees created memes about needing to revise their OKRs (quarterly performance goals). The page also references memes about Google Glass app ideas and other internal cultural moments. These examples illustrate how a permissive culture generates organic humor that both entertains and provides honest commentary on company direction. The memes serve as a democratic feedback channel that bypasses formal hierarchies.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Internal memes as a cultural barometer reflecting genuine employee sentiment. Humor as a safe channel for expressing concerns about ambitious company goals. The OKR system as a cultural touchstone that employees reference and joke about. The self-regulating nature of democratic voting on memes -- the best (most resonant) commentary rises to the top naturally.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Pay attention to what employees joke about -- humor often reveals genuine concerns or insights. Create channels for informal feedback that complement formal review processes. Embrace employee commentary on ambitious goals as a sign of engagement, not dissent. Use internal humor platforms as early indicators of cultural health and employee sentiment.</p>
