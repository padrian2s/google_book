      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Jonathan's favorite 20% project digitized and published online the artifacts of Yad Vashem, Jerusalem's Holocaust remembrance center. The project started when Jonathan visited the museum with his family in 2007 and realized the youngest survivors were in their seventies and eighties -- their firsthand knowledge was literally dying out. Team Israel used their 20% time to create a partnership with the museum. Today over 140,000 images and documents are digitized and searchable, with survivors adding their own knowledge and stories. When Yossi Matias demoed the project for Larry and Sergey, their response was typical: "Why only this museum? Why not all museums?" This led to Google's Open Gallery product and the Google Cultural Institute.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>This story illustrates how 20% time can serve humanitarian purposes that no business case would justify. The project arose from personal passion, not corporate strategy. Larry and Sergey's response -- "why not all museums?" -- shows how thinking big can transform a single initiative into a platform. The progression from one museum to all museums to all cultural content demonstrates the pattern of starting specific and scaling broadly.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Allow passion projects that serve humanitarian goals, even without clear business cases. When a project succeeds, ask "why not scale this?" rather than celebrating the narrow win. Build platforms that enable others to replicate individual successes broadly. Connect personal passion with organizational capability for maximum impact.</p>
