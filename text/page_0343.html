      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Endnote 181 clarifies the distinction between "20 percent time" and the "70/20/10" resource allocation model. Twenty percent time is about individual freedom -- allowing engineers to spend a portion of their time on self-directed projects. The 70/20/10 framework is about organizational resource management -- allocating 70% to core business, 20% to adjacent opportunities, and 10% to transformational bets. The authors humorously note that adopting "70/19/11" might have been less confusing.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The distinction between individual and organizational innovation frameworks is important. Twenty percent time empowers individuals, while 70/20/10 provides strategic portfolio allocation. Both serve the goal of fostering innovation, but they operate at different levels and serve different purposes. Together, they create a system where innovation is both a bottom-up individual activity and a top-down strategic priority.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Implement both individual and organizational innovation frameworks. At the individual level, give people time and permission to explore their own ideas. At the organizational level, deliberately allocate resources across a portfolio of core, adjacent, and transformational initiatives. Make sure the two frameworks complement rather than conflict with each other, and communicate clearly about the purpose and scope of each.</p>
