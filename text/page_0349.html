      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (187) explains the cultural reference to "The Gong Show," a 1970s TV talent show where most acts were terrible and any performance could be cut short by a judge striking a loud gong. The authors use this as a metaphor in the main text for a rapid idea-evaluation process.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Google adapted the Gong Show concept as an internal mechanism for quickly evaluating ideas. The metaphor captures the spirit of fast, decisive feedback -- ideas are presented and either advance or are "gonged." This reflects the company's bias toward speed in decision-making and its comfort with blunt, honest evaluation.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Consider implementing rapid idea-pitch sessions where teams can present concepts and get fast feedback. The key is creating a culture where being "gonged" is not shameful but is simply part of the iterative process. Quick rejection of weak ideas frees up resources for pursuing stronger ones.</p>
