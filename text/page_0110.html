      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>One of the most important decisions any business leader makes is how to spend their time. When Eric became CEO of Novell in 1997, Bill Gates gave him great advice: spend 80 percent of your time on 80 percent of your revenue. This rule is deceptively hard to follow. At Novell, the core business was NetWare, but Eric and his staff were excited about growing the new NetWare Directory Services (NDS). Leadership teams often underestimate how long it takes for revenue from new products to ramp up. The shiny new stuff is more interesting than the boring core business, but the core pays the bills -- make a mistake there and you may not recover. In retrospect, Eric should have spent more time on NetWare. You have to focus on your core business. You have to love it. Additionally, leaders must have a succession plan. Your successor is already in your organization -- look for outstanding smart creatives progressing rapidly and ask if they could run the company in ten years.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The 80/80 rule is a practical heuristic for the perennial leadership challenge of balancing innovation with execution. The Novell story provides a cautionary tale from Eric's own experience -- even smart leaders get seduced by exciting new opportunities at the expense of the core business. The succession planning advice mirrors the hiring philosophy: look for trajectory and potential rather than current position. Eric's personal realization about needing a coach (Bill Campbell) connects to the earlier themes about humility and continuous learning -- even the CEO needs someone to observe them and provide honest feedback.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Audit your calendar: does 80 percent of your time go to the activities generating 80 percent of your revenue? If not, deliberately rebalance. Resist the allure of exciting new projects at the expense of core business attention. Start succession planning early by identifying high-potential smart creatives and investing in their development. Look for the successor who could run the company in a decade, not just the next year. Accept that you need a coach -- every world-class performer has one, and business leaders should too.</p>
