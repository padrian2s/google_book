      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The inclusion of a simple glossary-style endnote reflects the book's intent to be accessible to a broad audience, not just technology insiders. CGI represents one of many fields where computing power has fundamentally transformed a creative industry, aligning with the book's themes about technology as an enabler of human creativity and the importance of combining technical and creative skills.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When communicating about technology, do not assume your audience shares your vocabulary. Providing clear, concise definitions -- as this endnote does -- ensures your message reaches the widest possible audience. Accessibility in communication is itself a form of good design.</p>
