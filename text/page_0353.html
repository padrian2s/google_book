      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This endnote (191) connects to the concept of "Underpromise, Overdeliver," popularized by Tom Peters in his book "Thriving on Chaos: Handbook for a Management Revolution" (1988). The principle advocates setting expectations conservatively and then exceeding them.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>The "underpromise, overdeliver" principle ties together several themes in the book: managing expectations, building trust through consistent delivery, and maintaining credibility with stakeholders. In a company like Google that sets audacious goals (moonshots), this principle helps manage the tension between ambitious vision and realistic execution.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>When setting timelines and deliverables, build in realistic buffers. It is far better to pleasantly surprise stakeholders with early or better-than-expected delivery than to disappoint with missed deadlines or incomplete work. This builds a track record of reliability that earns you more freedom and trust over time.</p>
