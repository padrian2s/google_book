      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Google economist Hal Varian describes our era as one of "combinatorial innovation" -- when many component parts become available and can be combined in new ways. In the 1800s, standardized mechanical devices (gears, pulleys, chains) drove a manufacturing boom. In the 1900s, the gasoline engine spawned automobiles, motorcycles, and airplanes. By the 1950s, integrated circuits proliferated. Today, the components are information, connectivity, and computing. Inventors have access to the world's information, global reach, infinite computing power, open-source software, abundant APIs, and data platforms covering everything from traffic to genetics. One approach is combining accessible technologies with industry-specific expertise. Another is starting with a narrow solution and broadening it -- steam engines pumped water before powering locomotives; Marconi sold radio for ship communications; Bell Labs initially undervalued the laser; the Internet was designed for academic research sharing.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Historical cycles of combinatorial innovation driven by newly available components. The pattern of technologies being invented for narrow purposes then finding broader applications. Every industry has its own "technical expertise" that can be combined with Internet Century capabilities. The current wave of combinatorial innovation driven by information, connectivity, and computing components. The principle that looking for broader applications of narrow solutions is a reliable source of technical insights.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Look for opportunities to combine newly available technology components (data, connectivity, computing) with your industry's specific expertise. When you develop a solution for a narrow problem, actively look for ways to broaden its scope. Study the history of innovation -- most breakthrough technologies started as solutions to narrow problems. Leverage open-source tools, APIs, and data platforms to build on existing work rather than starting from scratch.</p>
